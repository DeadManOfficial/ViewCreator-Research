4. **thinking-deeply**: This is a metacognitive skill that engages a structured analysis protocol to explore multiple perspectives and context dependencies before formulating a response, particularly when users ask confirmation-seeking questions or make leading statements.","The skills in this repository fall into three primary categories, reflecting a strong focus on scientific research and advanced cognitive processing:

1.  **Scientific Computing & Bioinformatics:** Skills designed to automate complex, multi-step workflows in biological and phylogenetic research.
    *   *Examples:* `biogeobears` (phylogenetic biogeographic analysis), `busco-phylogeny` (phylogenomics workflow generation).

2.  **Data Processing & Extraction:** Skills focused on transforming unstructured or semi-structured data (like scientific literature) into validated, structured datasets ready for analysis.
    *   *Example:* `extract-from-pdfs` (structured data extraction from scientific PDFs).

3.  **Cognitive & Metacognition:** An internal skill dedicated to improving the quality of the AI's reasoning, ensuring responses are nuanced, context-aware, and avoid confirmation bias.
    *   *Example:* `thinking-deeply` (structured analysis and multi-perspective exploration).","The repository features two particularly notable skills that demonstrate the breadth of potential Claude applications: one focused on complex scientific data extraction and the other on internal cognitive structuring.

1.  **`extract-from-pdfs` (Scientific Data Extraction Pipeline)**
    This skill is a sophisticated, multi-step pipeline designed to solve the common scientific problem of extracting structured data from large collections of research papers (PDFs) for systematic reviews or meta-analyses. It goes far beyond simple summarization by enforcing a rigorous, quality-controlled workflow. The skill's core functionality includes organizing metadata, filtering papers by abstract using various model backends (Haiku, Sonnet, or local Ollama), performing the actual structured data extraction from PDFs using Claude's vision capabilities, repairing the resulting JSON output, and enriching the data through external API validation (e.g., GBIF, PubChem). Crucially, it includes an optional, but highly recommended, validation workflow that samples extracted data, allows for manual ground-truthing, and calculates precision, recall, and F1 metrics. This focus on quality assurance and metric-driven improvement makes it a powerful tool for academic and research applications where data integrity is paramount.

2.  **`thinking-deeply` (Structured Cognitive Analysis)**
    This skill is unique as it is a metacognitive tool designed to improve the quality of the AI's own reasoning and response generation. It activates when the user presents confirmation-seeking questions, leading statements, or binary choices that might otherwise lead to a quick, un-nuanced response. The skill enforces a five-step internal protocol: **Pause and Recognize** the underlying assumptions; **Reframe the Question** into a broader, neutral investigation; **Map the Landscape** by considering multiple perspectives, context dependencies, and trade-offs; **Structured Response Format** to present the analysis clearly; and finally, a list of **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**. By systematically forcing the consideration of alternative viewpoints and contextual factors, this skill ensures that the final recommendation is thoughtful, nuanced, and directly addresses the user's actual needs rather than just validating their initial premise.","The skills in this repository are designed to be integrated into a Claude-based workflow, typically involving a combination of file management, script generation, and execution within a sandboxed environment. The general usage pattern involves the following steps:

1.  **Repository Setup:** The first step is to clone the repository to access the skill files and associated scripts: `gh repo clone brunoasm/my_claude_skills`.
2.  **Skill Activation:** The AI identifies the appropriate skill based on the user's request (e.g., a request for ancestral range reconstruction triggers `biogeobears`).
3.  **Parameter Gathering:** The AI uses the detailed `SKILL.md` documentation to systematically ask the user for all necessary inputs and parameters (e.g., file paths, taxonomic scope, computing environment).
4.  **Workflow Generation:** The skill executes its core function, which often involves generating customized, executable scripts (e.g., RMarkdown for `biogeobears`, SLURM/PBS job scripts for `busco-phylogeny`) and organizing a dedicated project directory structure.
5.  **Execution Guidance:** The AI provides the user with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to execute the generated scripts in their local environment, including necessary software installation commands (e.g., `conda` or `R` package installations).
6.  **Result Interpretation:** After the user runs the analysis, the AI can use the skill's documentation to help interpret the results, troubleshoot issues, and guide subsequent steps (e.g., using the validation workflow in `extract-from-pdfs`).

For the cognitive skill, `thinking-deeply`, usage is internal and automatic, applying a structured thought process before generating a final response to the user.",

2. **PowerPoint (`pptx`)**: This skill enables the generation of professional presentations, complete with slides, charts, and transitions, suitable for business reporting.
3. **PDF (`pdf`)**: This skill is used to create formatted PDF documents, which can include text, tables, and images for final report distribution.
4. **Word (`docx`)**: This skill allows Claude to generate Word documents, supporting rich text formatting and complex document structures.","The skills and examples in this source fall into three primary categories:

*   **Document Generation**: Focuses on the creation and manipulation of professional file formats.
    *   *Examples*: Creating Excel workbooks (`xlsx`), generating PowerPoint presentations (`pptx`), formatting PDF documents (`pdf`), and structuring Word documents (`docx`).
*   **Data Analysis & Reporting**: Involves using the document generation skills to process data and produce insightful reports.
    *   *Examples*: Building financial dashboards, performing portfolio analysis, conducting budget variance analysis, and compiling automated quarterly reports.
*   **Custom Skill Development**: Provides the framework and guidance for developers to build their own specialized, domain-specific tools for Claude.
    *   *Examples*: Building a financial ratio calculator, creating a company brand guidelines skill, and developing advanced financial modeling suites.","The Anthropic Cookbook's Skills section is notable for its comprehensive focus on **Built-in Document Generation Skills** and a practical, domain-specific application to **Financial Analysis and Reporting**.

The core feature highlighted is the set of four built-in skills: `xlsx` (Excel), `pptx` (PowerPoint), `pdf` (PDF), and `docx` (Word). These skills are unique in that they enable Claude to directly create and manipulate complex, professional file formats. This capability is a significant advancement for business automation, allowing the agent to generate Excel workbooks complete with formulas, charts, and formatting, as well as structured presentations and documents. The cookbook provides the necessary technical details, including the required beta headers (`code-execution`, `files-api`, `skills`) and the process for using the Files API to download the generated files, which is crucial for practical implementation.

Furthermore, the repository's structure and examples are heavily weighted toward **Financial Applications**. Notebooks and sample data are provided for building financial dashboards, performing portfolio analysis, and executing complex cross-format workflows (e.g., converting CSV data into an Excel report, then into a PowerPoint presentation, and finally exporting to PDF). This focus provides developers with high-value, production-ready blueprints for creating agents specialized in business and financial analytics. The inclusion of a **Custom Skills Development Framework** also stands out, offering a clear path for developers to extend Claude's capabilities with specialized, proprietary logic, such as a financial ratio calculator or a brand guidelines checker, ensuring the agent can adapt to company-specific workflows.","To access and utilize the skills demonstrated in this cookbook, follow these step-by-step instructions:
