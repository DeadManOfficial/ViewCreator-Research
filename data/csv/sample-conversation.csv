1 — Right (Jordan):
Hey, can we talk later? I’m in the middle of something important.

2 — Left (Alex):
Yeah, I figured. The “important thing” just liked your Instagram story.

3 — Right (Jordan):
That doesn’t mean anything.

4 — Left (Alex):
Her username is literally “Jordan’sSideQuest.”

5 — Right (Jordan):
It’s… a gaming reference?

6 — Left (Alex):
Sure. And the selfie she posted from your hoodie is “cosplay,” right?

7 — Right (Jordan):
It’s a common hoodie. Anyone could have it.

8 — Left (Alex):
Funny. She spelled your name wrong in the caption but still got your birthdate right.

9 — Right (Jordan):
Okay that was a lucky guess.

10 — Left (Alex):
She tagged the restaurant you took me to last week. Same table. Same booth. Same broken ketchup bottle.

11 — Right (Jordan):
Coincidence.

12 — Left (Alex):
Jordan, the bottle has our initials carved into it.

13 — Right (Jordan):
Alright, but that carving could mean anything.

14 — Left (Alex):
Yeah. “A + J forever” absolutely screams creative ambiguity.

15 — Right (Jordan):
Why are you being so dramatic?

16 — Left (Alex):
Oh don’t worry. I’m calm.
But your mom just DM’d me asking why your “study partner” tagged her in a photo.

17 — Right (Jordan):
WAIT. WHAT PHOTO?!

18 — Left (Alex):
The one where she’s wearing your hoodie and your dignity.

19 — Right (Jordan):
ALEX PLEASE DON’T—

20 — Left (Alex):
Relax.
I already told her you’re “busy.”
Like you said.
