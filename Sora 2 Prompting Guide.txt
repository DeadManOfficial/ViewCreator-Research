🧭 What Is a “Strong Prompt”?
A strong prompt is one that gives Sora just the right amount of specific, visually grounded detail — enough for the model to clearly understand what to generate — without overloading it with contradictions, vagueness, or too many actions.
Think of it like giving direction to a cinematographer who can perfectly visualize what you describe, but can’t ask questions later.
You’re describing one shot — not a whole film — and your words are the only “storyboard.”
________________


🎞️ Strong Prompt vs. Weak Prompt (Example)
Weak Prompt
	Strong Prompt
	“A beautiful street at night.”
	“Wet asphalt, zebra crosswalk, neon signs reflecting in puddles.”
	“A person moves quickly.”
	“A cyclist pedals three times, brakes, and stops at the crosswalk.”
	“Cinematic look.”
	“Anamorphic 2.0x lens, shallow DOF, volumetric light from streetlamps.”
	The strong prompt gives the model visual cues it can actually render — texture, motion, light, and timing.
Words like “beautiful,” “cool,” or “cinematic” don’t mean much to the model unless you define what that looks like.

🧩 Key Traits of a Strong Sora Prompt
1. Specific and Visual
                           * Use concrete nouns and verbs: “raindrops hit glass” instead of “rainy mood.”

                           * Describe visible results, not emotions alone.
✅ “A single candle flickers beside a photo frame.”
 ❌ “A sad scene.”

2. One Clear Action + One Camera Move
                              * Keep motion simple and readable.
✅ “The actor walks three steps to the window, pauses, then looks out.”
❌ “The actor runs, turns, waves, and dances across the room.”

3. Defined Lighting and Color Anchors
                                 * Describe light quality + direction + color palette.
✅ “Soft window light with warm lamp fill, cool rim from hallway; palette: amber, cream, walnut brown.”

4. Stable Style & Lens
                                    * Tell Sora what kind of image it should emulate:
✅ “Shot on 35 mm film, handheld, subtle film grain.”
✅ “Digital 4K look, high contrast, cool tone palette.”

5. Temporal Beats
                                       * Break time into beats so the model knows pacing.
✅ “He opens the book — one beat — turns a page — one beat — smiles softly.”

6. Dialogue Clearly Separated
If there’s speech, format it cleanly:
Dialogue:
- Detective: "You’re lying. I can hear it in your silence."
- Suspect: "Or maybe I’m just tired of talking."


7. Intentional Brevity
A strong prompt doesn’t have to be long — it just has to be clear and layered.
Leave room for creative interpretation where it won’t break continuity.

🧠 Shortcut Formula for Strong Prompts
[Setting + Time], [Style], [Subject + Action],
[Lighting + Palette], [Camera Setup],
(Optional) [Dialogue / Sound cues]
Example:
“Golden hour in a quiet suburban street. Shot on 16 mm film with handheld movement and soft lens flares. A paperboy rides past in slow motion, tossing a newspaper onto a porch. Warm sunlight glows through the trees; palette: gold, sage, denim blue. Camera tracks alongside at eye level. Sound: faint bicycle chain and distant dog bark.”
That’s a strong prompt — concrete, cinematic, emotionally clear, yet leaves room for variation.
