# The Comprehensive Sora 2 Expert Prompt Guide: Styles and Structures

This guide compiles and categorizes expert-level Sora 2 prompt structures, moving beyond simple descriptions to provide templates for various video styles, art styles, and cinematic techniques. The goal is to give the user maximum control over the AI's output, aligning with the project's "Cinematographer's Shot List" philosophy.

## I. Core Prompt Structure: The Two Formulas

Expert prompting utilizes two main formulas, depending on the desired level of control and the complexity of the shot.

| Formula | Goal | Structure | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Prompts** | Fast, Creative, Low-Spec | **[Subject/Action] in [Environment]** | For quick B-roll, abstract concepts, or when you want the AI to "Let the AI Direct" and handle the lensing/lighting. |
| **High-Control** | Cinematic Precision, High-Fidelity | **[Subject/Action] + [Environment] + [Cinematography] + [Lighting] + [Movement] + [Technical Modifiers]** | For the "Ultra-Realism" aesthetic, multi-shot sequences, or when absolute brand consistency is required (e.g., the "DeadMan" aesthetic). |

## II. Prompting by Video Style (The "Format & Style" Layer)

The overall format and style must be stated upfront to lock in the right editing and rhythm.

| Video Style | Key Structural Components | Example Prompt Segment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ultra-Realism / Cinematic** | **Cinematography** (Camera/Lens), **Lighting & Color**, **Realism Modifiers** (Film Stock/Grain). | `Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 50mm anamorphic lens. High-contrast, teal and orange color grade. Cinematic film grain.` |
| **UGC Reaction Video** | **Format & Style** (Authentic, Handheld), **Camera** (iPhone/GoPro), **Pacing** (Fast, Impulsive). | `Format & Style: UGC reaction video – authentic, handheld, shot on front iPhone camera. Style: unfiltered realism, slight overexposure, raw and honest.` |
| **Documentary / Found Footage** | **Camera** (VHS/8mm), **Technical Flaws** (Noise/Glitches), **Pacing** (Slow, Observational). | `Shot on a 1990s VHS camcorder. Heavy tracking noise and static. Low-light, grainy, 4:3 aspect ratio. Slow, deliberate pan.` |
| **K-Pop Music Video** | **Pacing** (Fast, Energetic), **Movement** (Choreography, Dynamic Cuts), **Lighting** (Stage Lighting, High Saturation). | `A fast paced k-pop music video featuring 4 female idols. Dynamic cuts, high-saturation stage lighting, wide-angle tracking shot.` |
| **Anime Opening** | **Art Style** (Specific Anime), **Pacing** (Fast, Action-Oriented), **Multi-Shot Sequencing** (Character Introductions). | `Fast paced anime opening featuring a knight, a female mage, a dwarf and a schoolboy. Art Style: Studio Ghibli meets Cyberpunk 2077.` |

## III. Prompting by Art Style (The "Stylistic Control" Layer)

To ensure a consistent look, the art style must be defined early and reinforced with descriptive nouns and verbs.

| Art Style | Key Modifiers | Example Prompt Segment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Photorealistic** | Focus on texture, material, and light interaction. | `Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, volumetric lighting, subsurface scattering, extreme texture detail.` |
| **Watercolor** | Focus on medium and technique. | `Watercolor painting, wet-on-wet technique, soft edges, bleeding colors, painted on cold-press paper.` |
| **3D Animation** | Focus on rendering engine and specific style. | `Pixar-style 3D animation, rendered in Unreal Engine 5, highly stylized, smooth motion, vibrant colors.` |
| **Cyberpunk** | Focus on color palette and atmosphere. | `Cyberpunk aesthetic, neon-drenched, heavy rain, low-key lighting, high-contrast teal and magenta palette.` |

---

## IV. Prompting by Technical Parameter (The "Cinematography" Layer)

These parameters provide the AI with the most control over the final output's technical quality and feel.

| Technical Parameter | Purpose | Example Modifiers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Camera/Lens** | Controls depth of field, perspective, and distortion. | `ARRI Alexa 65, 50mm anamorphic lens, Leica Summilux-M 50mm f/1.4, Macro lens.` |
| **Lighting** | Controls mood, shadows, and realism. | `High-contrast, hard key light, soft box lighting, natural sunlight from camera left, sodium platform lights.` |
| **Color/Grade** | Controls the final look and emotional tone. | `Teal and orange color grade, Kodak Portra 400 color profile, cinematic film grain, subtle halation.` |
| **Movement** | Controls the camera's relationship to the subject. | `Slow, deliberate dolly zoom out, subtle handheld camera shake, smooth tracking shot, static tripod shot.` |
| **Format** | Controls the technical output for platform optimization. | `Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio, 4K resolution, 60 FPS, 2.35:1 aspect ratio (cinemascope).` |

## V. Advanced Techniques for Consistency

*   **Shot-Driven Instructions:** For maximum consistency, detail each shot like a storyboard by specifying its framing, depth of field, lighting, palette, and action.
*   **Multi-shot Sequencing:** When creating a multi-shot sequence, define each shot as a distinct block with its own unique setup, action, and lighting to maintain maximum control.
*   **Dialogue Handling:** Place short lines of dialogue in a dedicated “Dialogue” block to ensure the most accurate lip-sync and verbatim delivery.
*   **Pacing:** State the overall format and style to lock in the right editing and rhythm for a more cohesive video.

This guide provides the necessary tools to move from basic descriptions to professional-grade, highly controlled AI video production.
