# Community Code Search Analysis

## 1. Repository Findings
- **Direct Repositories:** No public GitHub repositories found for "ViewCreator" or "BridgeMind" core platform. This confirms it is a closed-source proprietary application.
- **Related Repositories:** Found "maddiedreese/vibe-coding-for-beginners" which outlines the general "Vibe Coding" philosophy but does not contain ViewCreator code.

## 2. Technical Clues from Social Media
- **TikTok/Instagram Clips:** Confirm the use of **Vercel** for deployment and **GitHub** for version control ("Code to Vercel & GitHub = auto deploy!").
- **Auth Flow:** "ViewCreator wants to access your X account" confirms standard OAuth 2.0 implementation for social connections.
- **Tech Stack Confirmation:** Multiple sources reiterate the "Vibe Coding Tech Stack 2025" as **Next.js + Supabase + Vercel**.

## 3. "Vibe Coding" Curriculum
- The term "Vibe Coding" has become a broader industry term, with courses on Coursera and Microsoft Learn. This suggests the *methodology* is public, but the *specific ViewCreator implementation* is not.
- **Key Takeaway:** We should follow the standard "Vibe Coding" stack (Next.js/Supabase) as it is the "official" way this application was built.
