1. ## Keyword Research & Strategy

**Keyword research** is all about pointing you in the right direction so you’re focusing on the terms that actually matter, the ones that will bring in more traffic for the time you spend. Just to be clear though: no SEO tool is the ultimate source of truth. Whether it’s DataforSEO, Ahrefs, or SEMrush, they’re all making educated guesses. Use them as a guide, not gospel.

**Competitor analysis** is one of those things people tend to skip over, but it’s ridiculously valuable. It saves you from starting from scratch, because by digging into what your competitors are already doing, you get a clear picture of what’s working in your niche, and more importantly, what you need to do better.

2. ## Website Structure 

Website structure is one of those things you can’t afford to mess up. If you get it wrong, you’ll spend months undoing mistakes and taking huge steps backward just to move forward again. In this walkthrough, I’ll show you how to set up your site in a way that helps you rank for the right keywords while also giving you room to grow in the future

3. ## Content Workflow

Creating content with AI that actually ranks isn’t nearly as complicated as people make it out to be.

There are really two main approaches: first, the customized route, where you spend a little extra time weaving in your own expertise and experience (this is what really helps content stand out).

Second, content at scale, which I’ll cover later in this tutorial using a tool called Machined.AI. What’s changed is the purpose: we’re no longer just writing for clicks, we’re writing to train large language models to associate our brand with the keywords we want to own. Yes, traffic from informational posts may be lower in AI search engines, but that doesn’t make them worthless. In fact, they matter more than ever, it’s just that success is measured differently now.

4. ## Local SEO

Local SEO can make or break your business. Done right, it keeps leads flowing and fuels growth; done wrong, you’ll stay invisible while your competitors scoop up the customers that should have been yours.

In this section, you’ll learn how to optimize your site for locality and set up your Google My Business profile properly it’s one of the strongest assets you have, and when treated right, it delivers leads on autopilot.

I’ll also cover some easy wins, like free local citations (basically local backlinks) and how to treat your Google Business profile more like a social media page to maximize visibility.

5. ## Technical SEO

Technical SEO is the part that keeps your site running at full power. A lot of people assume that having a website is enough to compete, but if the technical side is off, you’re basically showing up to an F1 race in a Prius.

In this tutorial, I’ll cover the essentials, like site speed, basic schema, and a few other fundamentals, so you can spot what’s holding your site back and make sure everything is firing the way it should.

6. ## Link Building

Backlinks are still one of the strongest fundamentals in SEO. They always have been, and they’re not going anywhere.

Building a solid link foundation is what signals to search engines that your site can be trusted. In this section, I’ll walk through a few ways you can build quality backlinks even if you don’t have a budget. And if you do buy them, for the love of rankings, don’t waste money on Fiverr links, stick to a reliable source like GetMeLinks (I’ll drop the link below).

7. ## Analytics

SEO analytics is where the numbers finally start telling you the truth about what’s working and what’s wasting your time. The catch is, most people struggle to turn those numbers into actual insights.

That’s where AI changes the game. If you know how to prompt it properly, AI can break down your analytics, point you toward the right keywords, and show you which actions will get you more of the traffic that actually converts. In this tutorial, I’ll show you exactly how to make AI your personal SEO analytics expert.
