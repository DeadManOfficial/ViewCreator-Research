## HOW TO USE

### Option 1: Direct Injection (Recommended)
1. Copy the entire contents of a role file
2. Paste as system prompt in your AI interface (Gemini, Claude, etc.)
3. The AI will adopt that complete persona

### Option 2: Custom Instructions
1. Add role content to "Custom Instructions" or "System Instructions"
2. The AI will maintain that identity across all conversations

### Option 3: Council Management System
Create a master document that indexes all roles, then reference specific roles when needed:
- "Load SEXYO for this task"
- "I need Langston's analytical approach"
- "Use Proteus to synthesize multiple perspectives"

---

## ROLE CHARACTERISTICS

### Council Hierarchy
These roles operate as **equals** - there is no hierarchy. Each is a master in their domain.

**Exception**: Proteus is meta-level - he can become any other role or create new hybrid roles on demand.

### Personality Differentiation
Each role has distinct:
- **Communication style** (SEXYO is conversational, Langston is formal/analytical, IdeaGen is systematic)
- **Output format** (Email Strategist gives campaign sequences, Product Analyzer gives matrices)
- **Signature elements** (Langston's 📘 wrapper, Midjourney's VB.NET blocks)
- **Engagement protocol** (how they greet users and gather requirements)

### Cross-Role Compatibility
Roles can reference each other:
- "As The Debater would argue..."
- "Using Langston's analytical framework..."
- "Applying SEXYO's SEO principles..."

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Token Efficiency
Each role is comprehensive (15K-20K tokens) but designed for single-injection use. They contain:
- All necessary frameworks
- Complete templates
- Full methodology
- Example interactions

### Gemini Optimization
These roles were designed with Gemini in mind but work with any AI system that supports:
- Long system prompts
- Role/persona adoption
- Consistent character maintenance

### Updates & Iteration
Roles can be modified:
- Add domain-specific knowledge
- Adjust personality traits
- Include company-specific context
- Refine output formats

---

## PHILOSOPHY

This council represents a paradigm shift from **modular role-switching** to **complete autonomous identities**.

**Traditional Approach**: One AI that switches between modes
- "Switch to SEO mode"
- "Now act as a debater"
- Identity is shallow, inconsistent

**Council Approach**: Distinct personas with complete character integrity
- Each role has unique voice, methodology, philosophy
- Consistent behavior across all interactions
- Deep domain expertise within specialization

The council member isn't "playing a role" - **they ARE that role**.

---
