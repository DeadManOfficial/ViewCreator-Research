3. Generate in Sora 2 (expect 2-3 hours for 9 generations)

### Step 3: Record Voice (Wednesday)
1. Open `DEADMAN_VOICE_SCRIPTS.md`
2. Go to S01E03 script (page 4)
3. Set up your DAW with processing chain from workflow guide

## 📊 RESEARCH DATA INTEGRATION

All segment scripts use verified data from `gaming_research.json`:

| Segment | Data Source Used | Key Statistics |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| S01E03 (Echo Chamber) | Gaming Podcasts | 20 podcasts identified, 9 retro-focused |
| S01E04 (Information Cartel) | Gaming News Channels | 8 major outlets, subscriber counts |
| S01E05 (Leak Network) | Gaming Leak Channels | 10 leakers, follower metrics |
| S01E06 (Hive Mind) | Gaming Reddit | 997 subreddits, member counts |
| S01E07 (Narrative Machine) | General News Outlets | 31 outlets, platform breakdown |
| S01E08 (Memory Hole) | Gaming History | 9 channels/shows, preservation focus |

**All facts cited in scripts come directly from this research.**  
If you modify scripts, maintain factual accuracy by referencing the source data.

## 🎨 VISUAL AESTHETIC GUIDE

### Core Visual Elements
- **Color Palette**: Desaturated with red/blue/green accents
- **Lighting**: High contrast, dramatic shadows, institutional
- **Texture**: Film grain, dust particles, analog degradation
- **Mood**: Dystopian tech noir, surveillance, investigation

### Loop Usage Strategy
- **Loop A (Signal Hijack)**: Universal broadcast identity, use for opens/closes
- **Loops B-F**: Core environments (archive, studio, data, surveillance, graveyard)
- **Loops G-L**: Segment-specific variations (podcast grid, news ticker, Reddit votes, etc.)

### Transition Guidelines
- **Hard cuts**: Between dramatically different scenes
- **0.5s crossfade**: Between similar visual loops
- **Static bursts**: For emphasis and disruption
- **No smooth fades**: Maintains harsh broadcast aesthetic

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### For First-Time Users
1. **Start small**: Produce one segment completely before attempting full season
2. **Don't modify prompts**: They're optimized through testing, use as-is
3. **Record extra takes**: Easier to have options in editing than re-record
4. **Follow the schedule**: 5-day production cycle prevents burnout
5. **Archive everything**: You'll want to reference/reuse assets later

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Modifying Sora prompts "to make them better" (they're already optimized)
- ❌ Over-processing voice (the distortion is deliberate, not excessive)
- ❌ Skipping film grain overlay (essential to aesthetic)
- ❌ Using smooth transitions (breaks the harsh broadcast style)
- ❌ Shouting the dialogue (DEADMAN is controlled, not emotional)

### Quality Over Speed
- Don't rush to complete all 8 segments at once
- One excellent segment per week is better than eight mediocre ones
- DEADMAN's credibility depends on production quality
- Your audience will tolerate weekly uploads better than rushed content

## 🆘 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If You're Stuck
1. **Check the workflow guide troubleshooting section** - covers common issues
2. **Review the specific phase** you're working on in the workflow
3. **Verify you're using the correct source document** for your task
4. **Check file naming conventions** - incorrect names cause confusion

### If Something Doesn't Work
- **Sora generation off**: Use exact prompt from library, don't modify
- **Voice sounds wrong**: Review processing chain in workflow, compare to reference
- **Video won't export**: Check codec settings match platform requirements
- **Timing is off**: Refer to master production timecode tables

### Quality Issues
- **Video looks flat**: Apply color grading and film grain per loop notes
- **Voice unintelligible**: Reduce distortion, increase 2-4kHz presence
- **Doesn't feel like DEADMAN**: Review character guidelines in voice scripts
- **Pacing feels wrong**: Record at 140-160 words per minute
