# Final Deliverable: Claude Subagent Suite and Comprehensive Document Consolidation

This final package delivers the complete set of documents you requested, along with the design for a **Claude Subagent Suite** engineered to operationalize the advanced roles and workflows detailed in those files.

## Part 1: The Claude Subagent Suite for Success

To directly address your need for a clear direction and to succeed with the materials provided, I have designed two specialized Claude Subagents. These agents are built on the **skills, prompts, and instructions** found in the *Claude AI Agent Profile* and the *Sora 2 Master Architect* documentation.

The Subagents are designed to be invoked within a Claude environment (such as Claude Code) to enforce the structured, high-precision workflows necessary for top-tier AI output.

### Subagent 1: @claude-brand-architect
*   **Role:** Holistic Personal Brand Architect
*   **Purpose:** To guide the user through defining their **Creator Code**, developing a strategic **Positioning Statement**, and executing the 6-Step **Audience Expansion Strategy**.
*   **Key Skill:** Translating abstract brand values into concrete, actionable steps and AI-ready visual prompts.
*   **Direction to Succeed:** Use this agent for all strategic planning, identity definition, and content positioning *before* generating any final assets.

### Subagent 2: @claude-prompt-master
*   **Role:** Sora 2 Master Architect / Iterative Scientist
*   **Purpose:** To enforce the **12-Layer GODMODE Prompt Framework** for all video and image generation, ensuring cinematic quality, technical precision, and the mathematical elimination of the "uncanny valley."
*   **Key Skill:** Translating creative vision into technical specifications (camera, lighting, motion data, time beats) and automatically generating a **Negative Prompt Kill-List**.
*   **Direction to Succeed:** Use this agent for all final asset generation. It forces a rigorous, code-like approach to prompting, which is the core skill required for high-fidelity generative AI.

**The full design and sample instruction sets for both Subagents are detailed in the attached file: \`claude_subagent_suite_design.md\`**

## Part 2: Comprehensive Document Consolidation

You requested the entire list of Markdown files—the prompts, the agents, the skills, and the workflows—not just a summary.

The attached file, **\`full_md_consolidation.md\`**, contains the complete, raw content of all relevant Markdown files found in the attached archive and the cloned GitHub repositories. This includes:

*   **Profiles:** The *Claude AI Agent Profile* and the *Sora 2 Master Architect Complete* profile.
*   **Workflows:** The *SORA2 PRODUCTION WORKFLOW*, *SORA2 TROUBLESHOOTING FLOWCHART*, and the *DEADMAN BROADCAST PRODUCTION BIBLE*.
*   **Prompts & Libraries:** The *SORA2 MASTER PROMPT LIBRARY*, *SORA2 PROMPT BUILDER*, and the *DEADMAN BROADCAST PROMPT BUILDER*.
*   **GitHub Documentation:** Key READMEs from the official `claude-code` and the community `awesome-claude-code` repositories.

This file is your single source of truth for all the raw documentation.
