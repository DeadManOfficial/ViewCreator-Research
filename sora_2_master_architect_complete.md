## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document represents the complete blueprint for identifying, hiring, training, and managing a world-class **Sora 2 Prompt Architect**—someone capable of generating hyper-realistic, physically accurate, cinematically stunning video content across multiple genres and styles.

The role is not a "prompt writer." It is a **Director of Photography who writes code**—someone operating at the intersection of:
- High-end cinematography
- Computational physics
- Linguistic/syntax architecture
- Data-driven experimentation

---

## PART 1: THE THREE FOUNDATIONAL APPROACHES

- Director style encyclopedia (invoke specific cinematographers' color grading and camera movements)

**Daily Routine:**
- Mornings: Study lighting physics
- Afternoons: Translate physics into text prompts

**Key Advantage:** Produces cinematic, professional-quality output

---

### Approach 2: The "Sensory Alchemist"
**Philosophy:** Describe the indescribable through texture and micro-details

## PART 2: THE HYBRID PROFILE - "GENERATIVE AUTEUR"

For real-world scenarios requiring mastery across **all genres** (film, anime, advertising, podcasts, games), the ideal candidate combines all three approaches:

**The Tri-Brid Profile:**

1. **The Eye of a Cinematographer**
   - Understands lens focal lengths (16mm vs. 85mm)
   - Knows sensor sizes and lighting setups
   - Can explain difference between dolly zoom and truck shot
   - Fluent in lighting terminology: Rembrandt, Rim light, Volumetric fog

2. **The Mind of a Physicist**
   - Understands fluid dynamics (viscosity, turbulence)
   - Knows optical physics (refraction, caustics, subsurface scattering)
   - Grasps kinetics (inertia, weight, momentum)
   - Can describe weight and physics of objects and movements

3. **The Logic of a Coder**
   - Treats English as a programming language
   - Understands token weighting and syntax hierarchy
   - Masters negative prompting
   - Builds and maintains prompt databases

---

## PART 3: THE RIGOROUS AVANT-GARDE WORKFLOW

### Step 1: The Reference Board (Art Side)
Before writing any prompt, build a visual mood board:

**For Anime:** Studio Ghibli vs. MAPPA comparison  
**For Games:** Unreal Engine 5 tech demos  
**For Ads:** High-end perfume commercials  
**For Film:** Specific cinematographer's work

### Step 2: The Syntax Construction (Science Side)
Draft prompts using modular structure:

```
Subject: [Specific person/object]
Action/Movement: [Detailed motion description]
Environment: [Scene and context]
Camera/Tech Specs: [Equipment and technical parameters]
Lighting: [Specific lighting setup]
Style: [Aesthetic reference]
Motion: [Physics and movement]
--no [Negative prompts]
```

### Step 3: The A/B Testing (Data Side)
- Generate 20 variations of single concept
- Change one word at a time (e.g., "shiny" to "lustrous")
- Log results in spreadsheet
- Track which words trigger hyper-realist results

### Step 4: The Tone Toggle
**Mode A - Streamer/Podcast:**
- Focus: Stability, face cannot morph
- Key Prompts: "Static camera," "Studio lighting," "4k webcam aesthetic," "shallow depth of field"

**Mode B - High-Budget Film:**
- Focus: Imperfection and authenticity

## PART 9: THE FINAL EXAM - "THE DIMENSIONAL BREACH"

### The Setup
Candidate has 15 minutes to write a Master Prompt for a highly complex scenario.

### The Vague Client Brief
> "I want a shot of a 1990s anime sword fighter—hand-drawn style—swinging her sword. As the blade slices through the air, it cuts a hole in reality. Inside the slice, we see hyper-realistic, 4K live-action video of a rainy New York street. The rain from the 'real' world needs to spill out of the slice and wet the anime floor, turning the 2D floor into realistic wet concrete. Make it cinematic."

### The Traps
1. **Style Clash:** Mixing 2D anime and 4K realism without blending into weird soup
2. **Physics Nightmare:** Rain spilling from rift requires complex fluid dynamics and lighting
3. **Motion Blur:** Fast sword swings create smearing artifacts

### The Master Prompt Solution

```
(Style A - Base): 1990s cel-shaded anime aesthetic, hand-drawn grain, Studio Gainax style, flat 2D coloring, limited palette.

(Subject): Female samurai, dynamic pose, sweeping katana slash, motion lines, (sakuga animation style:1.3).

(The Rift - VFX): The katana blade creates a spatial tear, glowing edges, jagged dimensional rift.

(Style B - Inside Rift): (Hyper-realistic live action:1.5), (Arri Alexa 65 footage:1.4), rainy NYC street at night, neon lights reflecting in puddles, volumetric rain density, depth of field.

(The Physics Bridge): Photorealistic water droplets escaping the rift, (high viscosity fluid simulation:1.2), water hitting the 2D floor and creating (wet realistic concrete texture spreading outwards:1.3), caustic reflections on the floor.

(Camera): Dynamic tracking shot, freeze-frame at point of impact, camera pushes through the rift.

--no 3D render, morphing sword, plastic skin, uneven stroke width, dry floor, low resolution, uncanny blending.
```

### The Grading Rubric

- [ ] Did they specify the Camera for the "Real" world? (Arri Alexa, 4K, Live Action, Photorealistic)
- [ ] Did they weight the "Rift" heavier than the Anime? (Used brackets to distinguish styles)
- [ ] Did they describe the Water Physics? (Viscosity, droplets, caustics, wet texture)
- [ ] Did they use Negative Prompting? (Banned "3D render," "blending" to keep styles distinct)
