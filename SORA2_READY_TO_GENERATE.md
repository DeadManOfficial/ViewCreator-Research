## 🔴 LOOP A: SIGNAL HIJACK
**Best For**: Opens, transitions, emphasis

```
Macro close-up of a customized radio broadcast console in a pitch-black room. A red "ON AIR" tally light flickers erratically at 2 Hz, casting harsh crimson illumination across scratched metallic dials and worn Bakelite knobs. Behind the console, a wall of vintage CRT monitors displays cascading green phosphor text and rapid binary code flashes. Camera: locked macro shot, 100mm equivalent lens, f/2.8 for shallow depth isolating the tally light with razor focus while monitors blur into ambient glow. Lighting: single harsh red key from tally light creating deep black shadows; cool cyan-blue fill spilling from CRT screens; high contrast ratio 20:1. Texture: dust particles visible in the red light beam, fingerprint smudges on chrome surfaces. Action beats: Light flickers on (beat 1) — holds steady (2 seconds) — double flicker (beat 2) — dims slightly (beat 3) — returns to full intensity.

## 📂 LOOP B: CORPORATE ARCHIVE ROOM
**Best For**: Exposés, document reveals

```
Wide shot of an abandoned corporate archive room, fluorescent lights flickering overhead at irregular intervals. Metal filing cabinets line concrete walls, drawers pulled open with manila folders spilling onto a dust-covered floor. In the foreground, a gloved hand slowly pulls a classified document stamped "CONFIDENTIAL - PROJECT PICARD" from a weathered folder. Camera: slow dolly forward from wide to medium shot, 35mm lens equivalent, steady Steadicam movement tracking at 0.5 feet per second. Lighting: cold overhead fluorescent tubes casting green-tinted institutional light; one tube flickers creating strobing effect; harsh shadows under cabinet overhangs. Color palette: institutional green, manila tan, oxidized metal gray, deep shadow black. Action sequence: Hand enters frame right (beat 1) — fingers grasp document edge (beat 2) — document slides out revealing red stamp (beat 3) — hand pauses, document fully visible (beat 4). Atmosphere: water stain on ceiling, cobwebs in corners, scattered paper debris, faint mold texture on walls.

## 🎙️ LOOP C: UNDERGROUND STUDIO
**Best For**: Podcast segments, manifestos

```
Low-angle view inside a claustrophobic makeshift broadcast studio built in a concrete basement. A vintage broadcast microphone hangs from a shock mount, illuminated by a single bare Edison bulb swaying slightly, casting moving shadows across foam acoustic panels zip-tied to exposed brick walls. In the background, tangled XLR cables snake across the floor toward a laptop displaying green waveform analysis. Camera: static low angle looking up at microphone, 24mm wide lens for slight perspective distortion emphasizing ceiling height, locked tripod position. Lighting: single warm 2700K Edison bulb as practical key light creating hard shadows; laptop screen provides cool blue fill on cables; one edge of frame catches red EXIT sign glow from off-screen. Color temperature: warm amber key contrasts cold digital blue. Atmosphere: visible dust motes floating in bulb light, condensation forming on exposed water pipes overhead, graffiti partially visible on brick. Action: Bulb sways gently left to right (3-second period) — shadows shift across acoustic foam — cables remain static.

## 🌐 LOOP D: DATA STREAM
**Best For**: Leaks, hacker aesthetic

```
Extreme close-up of a mechanical keyboard with RGB backlighting cycling through blue and purple hues. Fingers type rapidly in short bursts while holographic data streams flow upward from the keys, displaying fragmented text: "CLASSIFIED", "EMBARGO", "NDA BREACH". Behind the keyboard, three stacked monitors show scrolling terminal windows with white text on black background, IP addresses, and file transfer progress bars. Camera: macro close-up on fingers and keys, 85mm lens at f/1.4 creating bokeh on background monitors, slight handheld micro-shake for documentary realism. Lighting: RGB keyboard underglow as primary source (blue-purple gradient); cool white monitor spill as fill; one practical desk lamp with green banker shade off-frame right creating rim light on hands. Color scheme: electric blue, deep purple, matrix green, bone white text. Action choreography: Fingers strike keys in deliberate rhythm (beat 1: three keys) — pause half-second — (beat 2: rapid five-key sequence) — hands lift slightly — (beat 3: single emphatic key strike). Data stream animations: holographic text rises at 30px/second, slight digital glitch effect every 2 seconds.

## 🕵️ LOOP E: SURVEILLANCE FEED
**Best For**: Corporate espionage, leaks

```
Security camera perspective from ceiling corner of a corporate office hallway at night. Emergency exit signs cast red glow on white walls. A silhouetted figure in a dark hoodie walks toward camera carrying a messenger bag, stops at a door marked "SERVER ROOM - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY", glances up at camera, then swipes an RFID badge. The door opens, spilling bright blue server light into the hallway. Camera: fixed CCTV angle from 8 feet high, 16mm fisheye lens creating barrel distortion, simulated 720p digital compression artifacts and timestamp overlay "23:47:18" in top-right corner. Lighting: red EXIT sign practical lights; cool fluorescent hallway overhead creating flat institutional ambiance; harsh blue-white LED server room spill at door opening. Monochrome palette: desaturated near-grayscale with slight green tint typical of night vision mode, red and blue accents preserved. Action timeline: Figure enters frame from bottom (beat 1, 2 seconds) — walks forward three steps (beat 2) — stops and looks up at camera (beat 3, holds 1 second) — swipes badge (beat 4) — door opens revealing blue light (beat 5). Surveillance artifacts: slight digital noise, one frame drop at 4-second mark, faint VCR tracking line across middle of frame.

## 🎮 LOOP F: RETRO GAMING GRAVEYARD
**Best For**: Gaming history, nostalgia

```
Close-up dolly shot through a dark storage room filled with stacks of unsold video game cases and cartridges from failed launches. Dust-covered PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube boxes are piled haphazardly. In the foreground, a hand in a leather glove picks up a pristine copy of "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided" collector's edition, its shrink wrap still intact, holding it up to dim overhead light. Camera: slow dolly right-to-left at shelf height, 50mm lens at f/2.0 for selective focus separating subject from cluttered background. Lighting: single overhead 40-watt incandescent bulb creating warm but weak key light; deep shadows in background; dust particles visible in light shaft. Color grading: desaturated with warm sepia undertone, except game box art colors remain slightly punched. Atmosphere: thick dust layer on every surface, cobwebs connecting boxes, water damage stains on cardboard, faint mildew texture. Action beats: Hand enters frame (beat 1) — fingers brush dust from box surface creating small cloud (beat 2) — lifts box into light shaft (beat 3) — rotates box slowly revealing cover art (beat 4) — holds position. Background detail: visible game titles on spines including "Lawbreakers", "Anthem", "Marvel's Avengers".

## 📱 LOOP J: REDDIT VOTE MANIPULATION
**Best For**: Algorithmic control, hive mind

```
Close-up shot of a Reddit post comment section with vote count number rapidly fluctuating between wildly different values. Large upvote and downvote arrows glow bright orange and periwinkle blue, flashing erratically as the number changes. Post title visible: "Am I the only one who thinks [GAME] is overrated?". Behind the foreground post, multiple browser tabs show different gaming subreddits open simultaneously (/r/gaming, /r/NintendoSwitch, /r/pcgaming, /r/PS5) all displaying similar trending posts with nearly identical inflammatory titles. Camera: slow zoom into vote counter widget, 50mm macro lens creating depth separation. Lighting: harsh blue-white screen glow dominating; orange upvote button creating warm/cool lighting contrast on user's face barely visible in reflection. Color: Reddit's signature orange #FF4500 and periwinkle blue #5f99cf saturated to maximum intensity, background desaturated grayscale. Action timeline: Vote count rapidly increments upward from +47 to +2.3k (beat 1-2) — suddenly drops into negative territory -156 (beat 3) — stabilizes at controversial dagger symbol (beat 4) — numbers continue fluctuating chaotically (beat 5-8).

## 📡 LOOP K: NEWS HOMOGENIZATION
**Best For**: Media manipulation, narrative control

```
Split-screen grid displaying six different major news website homepages simultaneously (New York Times, CNN, BBC News, Reuters, The Guardian, Fox News) arranged in 2x3 layout. Each site initially shows different layouts and color schemes. All six are displaying coverage of the same gaming controversy with slightly different headlines. As camera slowly pushes in, the headlines begin to merge visually — text literally drifts from one screen to another, bleeding between boundaries. Within 8 seconds, all six displays show the exact same article with identical text and images, just with different logos. Background: faint scrolling news ticker showing repetitive scandal phrases. Camera: slow forward push into grid from wide to medium, 35mm lens, locked tripod preventing any drift. Lighting: harsh blue monitor glow creating flat institutional lighting washing across unseen viewer's position; slight vignette darkening edges suggesting surveillance observation. Color: desaturated institutional palette with blue-gray dominance, yellow highlighted text for emphasis. Action timeline: Six distinct websites load (beat 1-2) — headlines begin drifting between screens creating visual confusion (beat 3-5) — text fully merges, all screens display identical content (beat 6-8).

## 📼 LOOP L: VHS DOCUMENTARY DECAY
**Best For**: History erasure, preservation

```
Close-up static shot of a VHS tape with handwritten label reading "HIGH SCORE - Netflix Documentary Series" sitting on a dusty wooden shelf. Tape case shows signs of age: faded colors, cracked plastic, yellowed label. Behind it on the same shelf, stacks of gaming history books with degraded spines barely showing titles, old gaming magazines curling at edges, and various physical game media (cartridges, CDs, DVDs) in cases showing water damage and sun fading. As shot holds, a leather-gloved hand reaches from off-frame and carefully grasps a pristine LaserDisc titled "CONSOLE WARS DOCUMENTARY" sitting in protective case. Camera: slow dolly back from macro close-up to medium wide revealing storage unit context, 50mm lens with shallow depth of field keeping VHS tape sharp while background gradually comes into focus. Lighting: single overhead 60-watt incandescent bulb creating dramatic top-down key light with harsh shadows; shaft of light cutting through dusty air creating visible god-ray particles; deep shadows in storage unit corners. Color: warm sepia tone degradation on aged media, punched vibrant colors on pristine LaserDisc creating contrast, heavy vignette suggesting forgotten space. Action: Static hold on VHS showing tape degradation (beat 1-2) — hand enters frame from right (beat 3) — brushes dust creating small illuminated cloud (beat 4) — grasps LaserDisc firmly (beat 5) — lifts into light shaft revealing reflective disc surface and cover art (beat 6-8).

## 🔥 FRENCH ANALOG HORROR: THE ANCHOR

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion sequence. Opens on authentic 1990s French television news set — Channel 7 "Info Sept" branding visible in lower third. A composed female news anchor (40s, professional attire, teleprompter gaze) reads evening bulletin under harsh fluorescent studio lighting. At 3 seconds, signal corrupts briefly — vertical hold slips — static burst. Screen resolves showing the anchor, but now a second figure occupies the frame: a man in a distressed grey business suit, face partially obscured by datamoshing artifacts, standing motionless 2 meters behind her right shoulder. The anchor continues reading, oblivious. At 7 seconds, the figure's head snaps 90 degrees toward camera — movement stutters through frame interpolation glitches — creates 4 ghost images trailing the motion. Anchor falters mid-sentence, eyes darting nervously. At 11 seconds, the figure's mouth opens impossibly wide, revealing VHS tracking distortion instead of interior anatomy — pure horizontal tear across face. The anchor breaks character, whispers "Ce n'est pas dans le script" (This isn't in the script) — voice compressed through damaged audio codec. Final 2 seconds: Both figures freeze as broadcast cuts to color bars, accompanied by 1kHz emergency tone.

## 🔥 FRENCH ANALOG HORROR: THE VORTEX

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Channel 6 "TéléSix" weather segment in progress. Two presenters (male meteorologist 50s, female co-host 30s) gesture at green-screen weather map showing France. At 2 seconds, studio lights flicker — fluorescent tube audibly pops. When illumination returns, a third figure now occupies the frame: a field reporter (holding microphone marked "TéléSix") standing frozen at the edge of the weather map, facing away from camera. The presenters continue without acknowledging the newcomer. At 5 seconds, all three figures begin a synchronized micro-movement — heads tilting left in unison at 0.5 degrees per frame — movement stutter-loops creating echo effect. At 8 seconds, the field reporter's face (still turned away) begins rotating through the body — head passing through shoulder mesh like corrupted 3D model — completes 360-degree revolution while body remains static. At 11 seconds, all three faces simultaneously turn to camera and merge into single kaleidoscope pattern — six eyes, three mouths, arranged in spiral. Audio: original broadcast audio slows to 70% speed, pitch-drops, overlaid with subsonic hum (18Hz) below conscious hearing threshold. Final frame: perfectly normal broadcast resumes mid-sentence as if nothing occurred.

## 🔥 FRENCH ANALOG HORROR: THE MEME

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Channel 8 "Huit Direct" serious news hour. Silver-haired male anchor (60s, gravitas, three-piece suit) reports on economic policy. Lower third displays stock ticker. At 3 seconds, screen divides — picture-in-picture window opens showing grainy doorbell camera footage of an elderly grandmother waving at camera with exaggerated enthusiasm (internet-native absurdist humor juxtaposition). The anchor pauses, confused, attempts to continue. At 6 seconds, the doorbell footage grandmother freezes mid-wave — her image begins applying "deep-fried" color filters to the main broadcast — oversaturation bleeding into news studio — anchor's face shifts through green and red color channels. At 9 seconds, the grandmother in PIP window slowly turns to face the main anchor through the screen — breaks dimensional barrier — her pixelated hand reaches "out" of the PIP window, touching the anchor's shoulder. The anchor flinches visibly, breaking journalistic composure. At 12 seconds, both the anchor and grandmother face camera directly — grandmother's smile has been copy-pasted onto anchor's face — creating uncanny valley effect of serious journalist wearing absurdist expression. Audio: news broadcast theme distorts into chip-tune melody, anchor's voice echoes with "Amogus" sound effect (ironic horror). Final second: Anchor breaks fourth wall completely, says directly to viewer "I don't understand the internet" in defeated whisper.

## ⚡ VIRAL TEMPLATES

### The Glitch Transition
```
Photorealistic close-up of a human eye reflecting a screen showing scrolling code. The pupil dilates rapidly as the reflection glitches, fragmenting into digital artifacts. A single tear forms, but instead of rolling down, it pixelates and dissolves into data particles that float upward. The iris color shifts through an unnatural spectrum — electric blue to deep purple to warning-sign amber. Camera holds tight on the eye in macro detail, capturing every blood vessel and texture in the sclera. Lighting: harsh blue-white monitor glow as key light, creating sharp catchlights in the cornea. Background: pure black void. Duration: 10 seconds. Style: Hyper-realistic, unsettling, Black Mirror aesthetic.
```

### The AI Nightmare
```
Medium shot of a figure walking through a pristine corporate hallway. With each step, the environment behind them decays — walls crack, paint peels, lights flicker from LED to fluorescent to bare bulb. The figure's reflection in passing windows shows a different version of themselves: older, younger, different clothing, different decade. They never look at the reflections, maintaining forward focus with mechanical precision. Camera: Steadicam follow shot, 35mm lens, maintaining consistent distance. The perspective never cuts, creating claustrophobic continuity. Color grade shifts from warm corporate tan to cold institutional green as decay progresses. Final frames: the figure approaches a door marked "EXIT" but reflection shows door marked "ENTRANCE" — they push through and the screen whites out.
```

### The Impossible Shot
```
A continuous unbroken take showing a camera floating through physically impossible space. Begins in a raindrop falling toward city pavement — camera shrinks to molecular scale, passing through water tension — emerges inside the reflected skyline within the droplet — scales up as we exit through a window of a reflected building — now inside an apartment where a TV displays news footage — camera pushes INTO the TV screen — emerges on the news studio set — passes through the teleprompter glass — into the text itself — letters become architectural structures — camera weaves between sans-serif letterforms at building scale — exits through the period at end of sentence — emerges in deep space, the period becoming a distant star. Total elapsed time: 10 seconds. No cuts. Continuous motion. Scale ranges from nanometer to lightyear.
