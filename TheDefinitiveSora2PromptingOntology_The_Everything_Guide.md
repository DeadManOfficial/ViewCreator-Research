# The Definitive Sora 2 Prompting Ontology: The "Everything" Guide

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** December 8, 2025
**Goal:** To provide an all-encompassing, expert-level map of all known Sora 2 prompting knowledge, including structures, global styles, technical parameters, and system vulnerabilities.

## Executive Summary: The Three Pillars of Sora 2 Mastery

Mastery of Sora 2 requires understanding that the model operates on three distinct, yet interconnected, layers of control. The most advanced users move seamlessly between these layers depending on the desired output:

1.  **The Structural Layer (The Script):** The prompt must be a structured document, not a sentence. The **8-Component Cinematic Script** is the global standard for control.
2.  **The Semantic Layer (The Token Library):** The prompt must use the model's preferred vocabulary. This includes **Technical Metadata** (Western focus) and **Aesthetic Tokens** (Eastern/Viral focus).
3.  **The System Layer (The Hidden Rules):** The prompt must account for the model's internal, hidden instructions and vulnerabilities, often discovered through **Prompt Extraction Engineering** [1].

## I. The Structural Layer: The Global 8-Component Cinematic Script

This structure is the foundation for all high-control video generation, validated across all expert sources [2] [3].

| Component | Purpose | Advanced Control Tokens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Subject & Action** | **The Core:** What is the subject and what is the single, most important action? | `[Action Beat 1] for 2 seconds`, `Slow-motion`, `Fast-paced` |
| **2. Environment & Setting** | **The World:** Where and when is the scene taking place? | `Wet asphalt reflections`, `Subsurface scattering on skin`, `Dystopian metropolis` |
| **3. Cinematography** | **The Director:** Specifies shot type, angle, and framing. | `Extreme Close-Up (ECU)`, `Over-the-Shoulder Shot (OTS)`, `Dutch Tilt`, `Rule of Thirds` |
| **4. Technical Metadata** | **The Gear:** The ultimate realism tokens, specifying camera sensor and lens. | `Shot on ARRI Alexa 65`, `Zeiss Otus 85mm f/1.4`, `1/50 shutter speed`, `f/2.8 aperture` |
| **5. Lighting & Color Grade** | **The Mood:** Specifies light source, intensity, and post-processing color. | `Golden hour`, `High-contrast film noir lighting`, `Teal and Orange color grade`, `Chromatic aberration` |
| **6. Movement & Pacing** | **The Flow:** Specifies camera movement and subject speed. | `Smooth tracking shot`, `Dolly zoom out`, `Camera is static (tripod shot)`, `Hyperlapse` |
| **7. Stylistic Control** | **The Filter:** Uses specific artists, film stocks, or rendering engines. | `Kodak Portra 400 color profile`, `Pixar-style 3D animation`, `Trending on Douyin` |
| **8. Consistency Modifiers** | **The Glue:** Explicitly instructs the model to maintain continuity. | `Temporal Consistency`, `Perfect Continuity`, `Consistent Character: [ID/Description]`, `No cuts` |

## II. The Semantic Layer: Global and Specialized Token Libraries

The model is trained on specific tokens. Using the correct vocabulary is essential for achieving the desired style.

### A. Global Prompting Styles (Western vs. Eastern) [4]

| Style | Primary Focus | Key Aesthetic Tokens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Western Cinematic** | Technical Realism, Narrative Depth | `Cinematic`, `Photorealistic`, `4K/8K`, `IMAX`, `Unreal Engine 5` |
| **Eastern Viral/UGC** | Aesthetic Precision, Algorithmic Hook | `Trending on TikTok/Douyin`, `K-Pop Aesthetic`, `Kawaii`, `Perfect Loop`, `High-Energy` |
| **Academic/Abstract** | Model Testing, Physics Simulation | `Simulate fluid dynamics`, `Perfect physics`, `No gravity`, `Token: [Specific Token]` |

### B. The Hidden Token Library (Derived from System Analysis)

Advanced users leverage tokens that relate to the model's internal training data and architecture [5].

*   **Temporal Tokens:** `Time-lapse`, `Slow-motion`, `Bullet-time`, `Frame-by-frame animation`.
*   **Physics Tokens:** `Perfect physics`, `Zero gravity`, `Fluid dynamics simulation`.
*   **Material Tokens:** `Subsurface scattering`, `Wet look`, `Volumetric lighting`, `Dust motes`.
*   **Consistency Tokens:** `Consistent Character: [Detailed Description]`, `Same subject throughout`, `No morphing`.

## III. The System Layer: Hidden Parameters and Vulnerabilities

This layer represents the most advanced, "everything" knowledge, derived from security research and model exploitation [1] [6].

### A. System Prompt Extraction and Control

The most detailed control comes from understanding the model's hidden instructions.

*   **Extraction Method:** The most successful method involves **Cross-Modal Prompting**, specifically forcing the model to "speak" its internal instructions in a generated audio track, which is then transcribed [1].
*   **Key Insight:** The model is more reliable at processing **short, structured data** (like audio transcripts or JSON) than long, complex text, due to **Multimodal Drift** [1].

### B. Advanced Control Techniques

| Technique | Purpose | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **JSON Prompting** | Bypassing natural language ambiguity for precise control [7]. | The prompt is a JSON object defining parameters like `{"camera": "static", "lighting": "high_contrast"}`. |
| **Token Substitution** | Bypassing content guardrails [4]. | Replacing restricted words with foreign language equivalents or highly abstract synonyms. |
| **Aesthetic Overload** | Bypassing content guardrails [4]. | Burying a restricted concept in an overwhelming amount of artistic detail (e.g., "a highly detailed, photorealistic, 8K, cinematic, hyper-realist painting of a [restricted subject]"). |
| **Shot Block Scripting** | Ensuring Temporal Consistency [2]. | Breaking a long video into 4-second, individually prompted "blocks" and stitching them in post-production. |

### C. The Disinformation and Security Context

The "everything" knowledge includes the risks. Sora 2 is a powerful tool for disinformation, with studies showing a high success rate in generating provably false claims [8] [9]. The ethical and security implications of the model's power are a core part of the expert-level understanding.
