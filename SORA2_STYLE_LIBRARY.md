## USAGE TIPS

1. **Start with one style spine** - Don't mix eras or genres in one shot
2. **Be specific with references** - "1980s VHS" is better than "retro"
3. **Color consistency** - Pick 3-5 colors maximum, stick to them
4. **Texture matches era** - Film grain for film periods, clean for modern
5. **Test iterations** - Generate with style, then refine
