    "technical_requirements": "*   **CPU/GPU**: A modern multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X) paired with a dedicated GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT). The GPU's dedicated encoder (NVENC or AMF) is critical for offloading the encoding process from the CPU, allowing for high-quality 1080p/60fps streaming while maintaining high in-game frame rates.\n*   **Internet Upload Speed**: A minimum stable upload speed of **10 Mbps** is required for reliable 1080p/60fps streaming at the recommended 6000-8000 kbps bitrate. A speed of 20 Mbps or higher is recommended for a safety buffer.\n*   **OBS Configuration**: Use the **NVENC (New)** or **AMD VCE/AMF** encoder. Set the Rate Control to **CBR** (Constant Bitrate) and the Keyframe Interval to **2 seconds**. The Base (Canvas) and Output (Scaled) Resolutions should both be set to **1920x1080** for a true 1080p stream.\n*   **Microphone**: A high-quality dynamic microphone (e.g., Shure MV7 or Rode PodMic) with an audio interface or USB connection, paired with software noise suppression (NVIDIA Broadcast or AMD Noise Suppression) to ensure broadcast-quality audio.\n*   **Webcam/Camera**: A dedicated mirrorless camera (e.g., Sony ZV-E10) or a high-end webcam (e.g., Logitech Brio) capable of 1080p/60fps output, connected via a capture card (e.g., Elgato Cam Link) for superior video quality.",

    "technical_requirements": "*   **Streaming PC/Hardware**: A minimum of 16GB RAM, a multi-core processor (e.g., Intel i7/AMD Ryzen 7 or better), and a dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30-series or equivalent) are recommended for smooth 1080p/60fps encoding and multi-source streaming. For mobile-first Shorts, a modern smartphone (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra) with high-quality video capture and editing capabilities is essential [1].\n*   **Audio and Video Capture**: A dedicated XLR or USB condenser microphone (e.g., Shure MV7 or Rode NT-USB) is non-negotiable for professional sound quality. For video, a dedicated mirrorless camera (e.g., Sony a6400) or a high-end webcam (e.g., Logitech Brio) is needed for long-form content, while the smartphone camera suffices for Shorts [3].\n*   **Encoding Software**: **OBS Studio** or **Streamlabs Desktop** are the industry standards for live streaming, providing the necessary tools for scene management, source mixing, and efficient H.264/H.265 encoding. Utilizing hardware encoders (NVENC for NVIDIA, AMF for AMD) is crucial to offload processing from the CPU [6].\n*   **Connectivity**: A stable, high-speed internet connection is mandatory. A minimum upload speed of 10 Mbps is required for reliable 1080p streaming, with 25 Mbps or higher recommended for 4K or multi-bitrate streams. A wired Ethernet connection is always preferred over Wi-Fi to minimize latency and packet loss [1].\n*   **Shorts Production Workflow**: A streamlined mobile editing app (e.g., CapCut, VN Editor) is necessary for quick turnaround of vertical 9:16 aspect ratio videos. The final output resolution should be 1080x1920 pixels [5].",
