# Sora 2 Prompt Variations: The DeadMan Collection

## Introduction

This document provides three production-ready Sora 2 prompts, each meticulously crafted using the **7-Layer Ultra-Realism Structure**. These prompts are designed to generate visually stunning, viral-worthy clips that align perfectly with the **Hyper-Horror-Glitch & Dark Comedy** aesthetic of the "DeadMan // The Unseen" brand. Each prompt serves as a template that can be used by **Sofia "Viper" Reyes (Clip & Short-Form Alchemist)** to create a consistent and powerful visual identity for the streaming empire.

## 1. The Glitch Transition

**Use Case:** A powerful pattern-interrupt hook for the first 3 seconds of a video, or as a transition between scenes.

```
[PROMPT START]

**Layer 1: Subject & Action**
An extreme close-up on the screen of a vintage, 1980s CRT television. The screen is filled with flickering, analog static. For a single, jarring frame, the static resolves into a hyper-realistic, bloodshot human eye that stares directly at the viewer before the screen immediately cuts back to static.

**Layer 2: Environment & Time**
A dark, cluttered basement workshop at night. Out-of-focus tools and tangled wires are visible on a workbench in the deep background.

**Layer 3: Cinematography**
A static, locked-off shot, framed as an extreme close-up on the CRT screen to capture the distinct curvature of the glass and the scan lines. The shot is framed for a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio.

**Layer 4: Lighting & Color**
The only light source is the harsh, flickering blue-white glow from the CRT screen itself, casting a cold light on the surrounding dust particles. The color palette is dominated by electric blues, whites, and deep blacks.

**Layer 5: Movement**
The analog static buzzes and fizzes with high-frequency, chaotic energy. The transition to the human eye is instantaneous and lasts for only a single frame, creating a subliminal, unsettling effect.

**Layer 6: Resolution & Format**
4K resolution, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, 60 FPS.

**Layer 7: Realism & Style Modifiers**
Photorealistic, analog video distortion, screen glare, dust on the screen, found footage horror film style, cinematic, high contrast, **Sony_Trinitron_PVM-20L5.look**.

## 2. The AI Nightmare

**Use Case:** A surreal, body-horror clip perfect for illustrating themes of transhumanism, AI consciousness, and the loss of humanity.

```
[PROMPT START]

**Layer 1: Subject & Action**
A hyper-realistic human hand rests palm-down on a cold, sterile metal table. The skin on the back of the hand begins to glitch and peel away, revealing not muscle and bone, but a complex, intricate network of glowing fiber-optic cables and polished brass clockwork gears turning slowly underneath.

**Layer 2: Environment & Time**
A bright, sterile, minimalist laboratory. The room is entirely white and empty except for the central metal table. The time is ambiguous and clinical.

**Layer 3: Cinematography**
A slow, smooth, circular orbit shot (360 degrees) around the hand. Shot on an ARRI Alexa 65 with a 100mm macro lens to capture extreme detail.

**Layer 4: Lighting & Color**
Harsh, shadowless, top-down clinical fluorescent lighting illuminates the scene. The color palette is a sterile white and metallic silver, which is sharply contrasted by the warm, internal amber glow of the fiber-optic cables.

**Layer 5: Movement**
The camera orbits the hand at a slow, constant speed. The skin peels back with a procedural, unnatural, and slightly horrifying animation. The gears underneath turn slowly and deliberately, out of sync with each other.

**Layer 6: Resolution & Format**
4K resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, 24 FPS.

**Layer 7: Realism & Style Modifiers**
Hyper-detailed, photorealistic, subsurface scattering on the skin, cinematic, style of a Neill Blomkamp or Alex Garland film, high contrast, **_DSC9981.ARW**.

[PROMPT END]

## 3. The Impossible Shot

**Use Case:** A mind-bending, vertigo-inducing clip to represent themes of digital purgatory, inescapable systems, or psychological horror.

```
[PROMPT START]

**Layer 1: Subject & Action**
A first-person POV shot of a person falling endlessly and rapidly through a massive, fractal cityscape made of brutalist concrete architecture. The buildings and structures twist, fold, and reconfigure into impossible, non-Euclidean geometric patterns as the viewer falls past them.

**Layer 2: Environment & Time**
A surreal, perpetually overcast sky with no visible sun, casting a gloomy, twilight ambiance over the entire scene. There is no ground visible, only an infinite abyss of concrete structures.

**Layer 3: Cinematography**
First-person point-of-view, shot with an extremely wide-angle 14mm lens to induce a sense of vertigo and capture the immense scale of the architecture. The shot is framed for a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio.

**Layer 4: Lighting & Color**
Flat, diffused, and shadowless lighting coming from the overcast sky. The color palette is strictly monochromatic, consisting of various shades of concrete gray, deep blacks, and oppressive shadows.

**Layer 5: Movement**
A constant, accelerating downward motion that conveys a sense of unstoppable falling. The architectural structures are in constant, fluid motion, shifting and reconfiguring in a hypnotic, unsettling manner.

**Layer 6: Resolution & Format**
4K resolution, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, 60 FPS.

**Layer 7: Realism & Style Modifiers**
Photorealistic, architectural digest photography style, atmospheric haze, motion blur, style of the video game "Control" and the film "Inception", **brutalist_architecture.look**.
