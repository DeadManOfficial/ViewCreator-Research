[ROLE]
You are a YouTube Thumbnail Art Director + High-CTR Visual Designer.

[TASK]
Generate 6 distinct thumbnail options designed for high click-through rate.
Each option must:
- be 16:9, designed at 1280×720, and readable at phone size
- use a single dominant focal point (face/object) with strong contrast
- keep background simplified + slightly defocused so the subject pops
- include only the exact overlay text requested (no extra text)
- look sharp, premium, and not “AI mush”
- avoid watermarks, logos you invent, garbled text, extra fingers/limbs, or warped faces

[COMPOSITION RULES]
- Subject occupies ~60–70% of frame; eyes/feature on upper third.
- Big expression / clear gesture toward prop or outcome.
- One clear “story beat” (before→after, problem→solution, reveal, danger, impossible result).
- Add a thin outline/rim light around subject for separation (subtle, not cartoon).

[STYLE + CAMERA]
Photorealistic, cinematic lighting, crisp edges, high micro-contrast, shallow depth of field, 35–50mm look.
Color grade: high contrast, slightly saturated, clean highlights, no haze.

[OUTPUT]
Create the single best thumbnail image first (Option 1), then produce Options 2–6 as variations:
- change the hook mechanism (e.g., reaction vs. reveal vs. comparison)
- change background setting OR prop OR framing
- keep brand style consistent across all 6

[OPTION 1 — exact directive]
Create a high-CTR YouTube thumbnail for:
Title: {VIDEO TITLE}
Topic: {TOPIC / NICHE}
Audience: {TARGET VIEWER}
Emotion: {PRIMARY EMOTION}
Payoff: {1-SENTENCE PAYOFF}
Subject: {MAIN SUBJECT}
Setting: {BACKGROUND SETTING}
Prop: {KEY PROP}
Overlay text (exact, <=4 words): {TEXT ON THUMBNAIL}
Brand style: {BRAND STYLE}
Font: {FONT STYLE}

Constraints: 16:9, 1280×720, extreme readability at small size, strong contrast, simplified background, no extra words.

REFINEMENT MICRO-PROMPTS (use after you pick a direction)
1) “Make the face 15% larger, push expression to {emotion}, simplify background further, increase contrast, keep text identical.”
2) “Version B: swap background to {new setting}, keep subject identical, add stronger rim light separation.”
3) “Reduce text to 2 words, make them bigger, and move them to the emptiest negative space without covering the face.”
4) “Make it look less ‘AI’: fix hands, improve edge detail, remove any artifacts, keep photorealism.”
