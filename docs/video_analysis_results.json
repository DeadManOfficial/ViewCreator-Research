    "description": "Day 96 is about closing the loop. Today, we are vibe coding the \"Holy Grail\" feature for ViewCreator: a fully autonomous Agentic Workflow that goes from raw content creation \u2192 scheduling \u2192 posting without human intervention.\n\nWe are pushing Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Code to their limits inside Cursor to wire up these agents. We\u2019ll also be debugging critical issues in our AI Clipping Agent to ensure perfect cuts every time.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s Community Day: we are hosting the weekly BridgeMind Project Sharing event, where members showcase what they\u2019ve been building.\n\nLinks\n\nViewCreator (Soft Launch): https://www.viewcreator.ai\n\nBridgeMind: https://www.bridgemind.ai\n\nDiscord (Join the Project Share): https://bridgemind.ai/discord\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@bridgemindai\n\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/bridgemindai\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/bridgemindai\n\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/bridgemindai\n\nWhat is ViewCreator? ViewCreator is a production AI platform for creators and teams. It generates thumbnails, captions, carousels, and titles, and converts long-form video \u2192 shorts using our AI Clipping Agent. The goal is to let creators schedule and post across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X, and LinkedIn from a single dashboard. Built on Next.js + NestJS + PostgreSQL on AWS.\n\nWhat We\u2019ll Do Today\n\nEnd-to-End Agentic Workflow: Wiring the final connections so a single prompt can trigger generation, review, scheduling, and posting.\n\nFixing the AI Clipper: Debugging the ffmpeg/rendering pipeline to solve the clipping agent's consistency issues.\n\nCommunity Project Sharing: Reviewing live demos and code from the BridgeMind community\u2014seeing what you guys are shipping!\n\nVibe Coding Loops: Using Claude Code for terminal-based refactoring and Opus 4.5 for complex logic inside Cursor.\n\nKeywords: vibe coding, ViewCreator, agentic workflows, AI agents, autonomous content, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Code, Cursor, Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, community showcase, project sharing, build in public, software engineering, AI automation.\n\n#VibeCoding #ViewCreator #AgenticAI #ClaudeOpus45 #Gemini3Pro #Cursor #NextJS #NestJS #BuildInPublic #Community #SoftwareEngineering #BridgeMind #AI",
