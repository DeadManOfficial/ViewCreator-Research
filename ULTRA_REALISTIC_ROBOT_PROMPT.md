## Ready-to-Generate Sora 2 Prompt

## FULL 12-LAYER IMPLEMENTATION

```
[LAYER 1: REALISM ANCHOR]
Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, subsurface scattering, _DSC09421.ARW, 
RAW photo, DSLR quality, natural imperfections, 8K resolution

[LAYER 2: SUBJECT & ACTION]
A humanoid robot sits motionless in a stark white diagnostic chamber, 
its chest panel open revealing intricate internal mechanisms. At 2.0s, 
the robot's eyes activate—irises dilating from pinpoint to full aperture, 
illuminating ice-blue. At 4.0s, the head rotates 15 degrees toward camera 
with mechanical precision, servos audibly whirring. At 6.0s, the exposed 
chest cavity begins self-repair—microscopic nanobots visible as silver 
particles flowing across damaged circuitry. At 8.0s, the chest panel 
begins closing, segments interlocking with surgical precision. The robot 
maintains unblinking eye contact with the lens throughout.

[LAYER 3: ENVIRONMENT]
Clinical diagnostic laboratory, near-future (2040s) aesthetic. Sterile 
white walls with subtle hexagonal panel texture. The robot sits on a 
brushed steel examination platform. Behind it, out-of-focus monitoring 
equipment displays vital readouts in cyan holographic projections. 
Temperature: cold, sterile, the air feels processed and filtered. 
A single observation window suggests human oversight, but no humans 
are visible. The space feels like a hospital crossed with a server room.

[LAYER 4: CAMERA SYSTEM]
Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 6K resolution downsampled to 4K for maximum 
detail retention, 24fps cinema standard, ProRes 4444 XQ

[LAYER 5: LENS SPECIFICATIONS]
ARRI Signature Prime 47mm T1.8, shot at T2.8 for optimal sharpness 
with pleasing background separation. Minimal distortion, clinical 
rendering appropriate for subject matter. Focus plane on robot's 
eyes with gradual falloff to chest cavity. Slight focus breathing 
as chest panel moves adds organic camera feel.

[LAYER 6: LIGHTING DESIGN]
Key: Large soft overhead LED panel (5600K, daylight balanced), 
     positioned 45 degrees above and in front, creating subtle 
     shadows under brow ridge and chin for dimensional modeling
Fill: Wraparound white cyc wall providing -2 stop ambient fill, 
      eliminating harsh shadows while maintaining dimension
Accent: Ice-blue LED strip inside chest cavity, providing internal 
        glow that spills onto robot's chin and inner panel surfaces
Practical: Holographic displays behind provide cyan accent spill
Eye Light: Small dedicated source creating catchlights in robot's 
           eyes, essential for "life" feeling
Ratio: 4:1 contrast - clean and clinical but not flat

[LAYER 7: COLOR SCIENCE]
Palette:
- Clinical White #F5F5F5 (walls, surfaces, 0% color cast)
- Titanium Silver #8C8C8C (robot chassis, brushed metal)
- Carbon Black #1A1A1A (panel gaps, deep recesses)
- Ice Blue #00D4FF (eyes, internal lighting, 100% saturation)
- Copper #B87333 (internal wiring accents, warm contrast)
- Nanobot Silver #E8E8E8 (repair particles, slight luminance)
Base Saturation: -10% global for clinical feel
Grade: Clean, neutral, slightly cold. Reference: "Ex Machina" 
laboratory scenes - sterile but not sterile to the point of 
unreality. Slight blue push in shadows. Clean highlights.

[LAYER 8: MOTION CHOREOGRAPHY]
Camera: Imperceptible 3-inch dolly push over 10 seconds (0.3 inch/sec), 
        so subtle viewers won't consciously notice but will feel 
        increasing intimacy/tension. Locked vertical, no tilt or pan.
Subject Movement:
- 0.0-2.0s: Robot completely still, uncanny valley stillness
- 2.0-2.5s: Eyes activate, iris dilation (mechanical, not organic)
- 4.0-4.8s: Head rotation 15 degrees, servo-driven, precise
- 6.0-8.0s: Nanobot flow in chest, microscopic but visible movement
- 8.0-10.0s: Chest panel closure, interlocking segments
All robot movement should feel mechanical but fluid—advanced 
engineering, not jerky or cheap. Think Boston Dynamics precision.

[LAYER 9: TEXTURE & DETAIL]
Robot Surfaces:
- Brushed titanium chassis with visible machining marks (not perfect)
- Micro-scratches from use/testing (lived-in, not showroom)
- Panel gaps showing engineering tolerance (hairline precision)
- Subtle fingerprint smudges from technician handling
- Serial number etched on shoulder plate (partially visible)

Internal Components:
- Fiber optic bundles glowing with data transfer
- Brass and copper connectors (warm metal contrast)
- Carbon fiber structural elements (weave pattern visible)
- Cooling channels with visible thermal paste
- Micro-hydraulic lines with fluid visible inside

Atmospheric:
- No dust (clean room environment)
- Slight condensation on cold metal surfaces
- Visible breath from robot's cooling vents (cold exhaust)

Film Characteristics:
- Minimal grain (clean, digital aesthetic appropriate for subject)
- Perfect sharpness in focus plane
- No vignette (clinical, open feeling)
- Slight lens breathing on focus pulls

[LAYER 10: TEMPORAL CONTROL]
Duration: 10.0 seconds
Frame rate: 24fps cinema standard
Speed: Real-time, no ramping

DETAILED BEAT TIMING:
- 0.0s: Static wide, robot motionless, chest open
- 2.0s: Eyes illuminate, iris dilation over 0.5s
- 4.0s: Head rotation begins, completes at 4.8s
- 6.0s: Nanobot repair sequence initiates
- 8.0s: Chest panel closure begins
- 9.5s: Panel locks, final servo click
- 10.0s: Robot holds new position, eyes locked on camera

[LAYER 11: STYLE ANCHORS]
Aesthetic: Sci-fi realism, clinical futurism, synthetic humanity, 
           silicon consciousness, :cybercore (subtle), engineering 
           beauty, functional design aesthetic
Reference: "Ex Machina" (Ava's internal reveal scenes) + "I, Robot" 
           (Sonny's design philosophy) + "Westworld" (diagnostic 
           scenes) + Boston Dynamics robot movement quality + 
           Apple product design philosophy (precision, materials, 
           gaps). NOT Terminator chrome skeleton—this is elegant, 
           considered, designed to work alongside humans.
Platform: YouTube premiere quality, 16:9. Can crop for vertical.
Quality tokens: Award-winning VFX, photorealistic CGI, practical 
                effects quality, film-quality robot design

[LAYER 12: NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS]
AVOID:
- Watermarks, text, logos, UI overlays
- Visible seams that look like bad CGI
- Rubber skin or silicone (this is exposed mechanical)
- Terminator/skeleton aesthetic (too aggressive)
- Glowing red eyes (cliché, threatening)
- Battle damage or weapons
- Jerky or cheap servo movement
- Motion blur on robot (should be sharp, precise)
- Lens flares (too cinematic/Abrams)
- Humans in frame
- Anachronistic technology (no visible wires unless internal)
- Face deformation or asymmetry (unless designed)
- Uncanny valley skin (no skin on this model)
- Dust or dirt (clean room environment)

BEATMAP:
H0.00: Static hold, uncanny stillness established
B2.00: Eyes activate, life begins
B4.00: Head turn toward camera, acknowledgment
B6.00: Self-repair initiates, technology revealed
P8.00: Closure begins, vulnerability ending
E10.00: Final form, eye contact, hold

AUDIO DIRECTIVE:
- Bed: Clean room air handling, very subtle white noise (-40dB)
- Bed: Faint electrical hum from equipment (-35dB)
- Event (2.0s): Soft iris servo whir, high-frequency
- Event (4.0s): Head rotation servo, deeper mechanical tone
- Event (6.0s): Nanobot activity, crystalline shimmer sound
- Event (8.0s): Panel closure, precision clicks, hydraulic hiss
- Event (9.5s): Final lock, satisfying mechanical CLICK
- Tone: Clinical wonder, not threatening. This is beautiful 
        engineering, not a weapon.
