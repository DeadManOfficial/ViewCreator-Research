## Recommendations

To build your streaming platform, it is recommended to start by creating a custom **Super-Skill** that combines the functionalities of the top 3-5 skills identified. This approach will create a powerful, specialized agent capable of handling the entire development lifecycle.

1.  **Combine `senior-fullstack`, `senior-backend`, and `senior-frontend`** to create a core development skill.
2.  **Integrate `senior-devops` and `webapp-testing`** to build a robust CI/CD and quality assurance workflow.
3.  **Leverage `web-artifacts-builder`** for rapidly prototyping and building the user interface components.

By adopting these skills, you can significantly accelerate the development of your streaming platform and ensure it is built on a solid technical foundation.
