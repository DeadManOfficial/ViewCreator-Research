**Director Style References** (describe aesthetic, don't use IP):
```
Instead of: "Like Blade Runner"
Use: "Dystopian noir aesthetic, neon reflections on wet streets, 
     constant rain, smoke, high contrast with saturated accent colors"

Instead of: "Like David Fincher"
Use: "Desaturated palette, green-tinted shadows, clinical precision, 
     locked camera, high contrast with crushed blacks"

Instead of: "Like Wes Anderson"
Use: "Symmetrical framing, pastel palette, flat lighting, centered 
     composition, whimsical production design"
```

**Platform Optimization Tokens**:
```
TikTok/Reels: "Trending on TikTok", "Viral-ready", "Scroll-stopping"
YouTube: "Cinematic", "4K HDR", "Premium production"

footage authenticity. Reference: Late 80s/early 90s local television 
production value - not polished network, but regional broadcast with 
budget limitations showing. Render quality: Photorealistic base with 
intentional VHS degradation applied. Platform: "Trending on TikTok",

# EXAMPLE: GODMODE PROMPT IN ACTION

## "SIGNAL HIJACK" - Full Godmode Implementation

```
[LAYER 1: REALISM ANCHOR]
Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, _DSC09421.ARW

[LAYER 2: SUBJECT & ACTION]
A red ON AIR tally light mounted on a vintage broadcast console flickers 
erratically at exactly 2Hz frequency, casting harsh crimson illumination 
across scratched chrome dials and worn Bakelite control knobs. The light 
snaps ON at 0.5s, holds steady 2.0-4.0s, executes double-flicker at 4.0s, 
dims to 70% at 6.0s, returns to full intensity at 8.0s, holds to end.

[LAYER 3: ENVIRONMENT]
Pitch-black broadcast control room, late 1980s institutional aesthetic, 
abandoned but equipment still powered. Behind the console, a wall of 
vintage CRT monitors displays cascading green phosphor text (DOS-style 
command prompts) and rapid binary code streams. Temperature feels cold, 
clinical, forgotten. Dust has accumulated on surfaces. The space suggests 
surveillance, secrecy, underground operations.

[LAYER 4: CAMERA SYSTEM]
Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 4K DCI (4096x2160), 24fps

[LAYER 5: LENS SPECIFICATIONS]
Zeiss Otus 100mm f/1.4 Macro, shot at f/2.8 for shallow depth of field 
isolating the tally light with razor-sharp focus while CRT monitors 
blur into soft cyan bokeh shapes. Slight focus breathing adds organic 
quality. Lens character: clinical sharpness with smooth falloff.

[LAYER 6: LIGHTING DESIGN]
Key: Red ON AIR tally light (2700K filtered through red gel), hard 
     single-source creating deep black shadows, positioned at subject
Fill: CRT monitor wall providing cool cyan-blue spill (9300K phosphor), 
      at -3 stops below key, creating color contrast
Practical: Green LED indicators on console equipment (motivated accents)
Ratio: 20:1 contrast - extreme noir, shadow areas fall to pure black

[LAYER 7: COLOR SCIENCE]
Palette: 
- Signal Red #FF2020 (tally light, 120% saturation - hero color)
- Phosphor Green #33FF33 (CRT text, 100%)  
- Cyan Blue #00FFFF (monitor spill, 80%)
- Chrome Silver #C0C0C0 (dial reflections, 60%)
- Void Black #0A0A0A (shadows, crushed)
Base Saturation: -30% global, then selectively boost red accent
Grade: Bleach bypass with cold shadows, crushed blacks at level 5, 
highlight rolloff at 250. Reference: David Fincher's "Zodiac" color 
science - clinical, desaturated, institutional.

[LAYER 8: MOTION CHOREOGRAPHY]
Camera: Locked tripod, absolute zero movement. Not even breathing room.
        The stillness is oppressive, surveillance-like, waiting.
Subject: Tally light flicker is only motion in frame
         - 0.5s: Snap ON (instant, 1 frame)
         - 4.0s: Double flicker (OFF-ON-OFF-ON, 4 frames each)
         - 6.0s: Dim (gradual over 0.5s)
         - 8.0s: Return (gradual over 0.3s)
Atmospheric: Dust particles drift imperceptibly through light beam

[LAYER 9: TEXTURE & DETAIL]
Surfaces: Fingerprint smudges on chrome dial surfaces (evidence of use), 
          dust accumulated in control grooves, Bakelite showing age 
          patina and wear at touch points, scratches on metal faceplate
Atmosphere: Visible dust particles floating in red light beam, density 
            appropriate for long-abandoned space - not theatrical, 
            realistic. Subtle.
Film: 35mm grain overlay at 20% opacity, Overlay blend mode, matching 
      Kodak Vision3 500T characteristics. Vignette 15% strength, soft 
      falloff. Chromatic aberration at extreme frame edges only (2px).

[LAYER 10: TEMPORAL CONTROL]
Duration: 10.0 seconds
Frame rate: 24fps (cinema standard)
No speed ramping - real-time throughout

BEAT TIMING:
- Beat 1 (0.0s): Black screen, equipment powered but tally OFF
- Beat 2 (0.5s): Light snaps ON - hard cut, immediate
- Beat 3 (2.0s): Hold steady, dust visible settling in beam
- Beat 4 (4.0s): Double flicker - electrical instability
- Beat 5 (6.0s): Dim to 70% - power fluctuation
- Beat 6 (8.0s): Return to full intensity
- End (10.0s): Static hold, ominous, waiting

[LAYER 11: STYLE ANCHORS]
Aesthetic: :horrorcore, :broadcastcore, analog signal intrusion, 
           numbers station, emergency broadcast, found footage
Reference: Late 1980s regional television production aesthetic, 
           public access broadcast equipment, pre-digital surveillance, 
           institutional horror. The visual language of secrets being 
           recorded. Reference films: "The Ring" (US) tape sequences, 
           "Zodiac" color science, "Videodrome" broadcast horror
Platform: Optimized for YouTube (16:9), generate 9:16 variation for 
          TikTok. "Trending on horror TikTok" potential.

[LAYER 12: NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS]
AVOID:
- Watermarks, text overlays, logos
- Modern equipment (nothing post-1995)
- Additional people or figures
- Face morphing/deformation
- Motion blur on tally light (should be sharp)
- Lens flares (too cinematic/modern)
- Color bleeding beyond specified
- Frame drops or temporal glitches (unless at flicker moments)
- Visible equipment outside of set design
- Clean/new appearance (everything should show age)

BEATMAP:
H0.00: Black, silence, anticipation
B0.50: Light ON, hard snap
B2.00: Steady hold, dust settles
T4.00: Double flicker, instability
B6.00: Dim, power uncertainty
P8.00: Full return, menace established
E10.00: Hold, the signal is active

AUDIO DIRECTIVE:
- Bed: 60Hz electrical hum at -30dB, felt not heard, continuous
- Bed: Cooling fan whir, very low frequency rumble
- Bed: Electromagnetic interference crackle, intermittent
- Event (0.5s): Hard relay click on light activation
- Event (4.0s): Flicker creates double-crackle burst
- Event (6.0s): Power sag whine as light dims
- Tone: Dread, surveillance, someone is watching, something is recording
