## The Ultimate Sora 2 Prompt

```
[PROMPT START]

**Layer 1: Subject & Action**
An extreme close-up of a cracked, porcelain doll's face lying on a dusty wooden floor. Its right eye is missing, revealing a dark, empty socket. Suddenly, a robotic, insect-like appendage made of brass and copper wires bursts out of the empty eye socket, twitching erratically.

**Layer 2: Environment & Time**
An abandoned, dimly lit Victorian attic at midnight during a thunderstorm. Rain streaks down a grimy, circular window in the background. Cobwebs hang from wooden rafters.

**Layer 3: Cinematography**
Shot on an ARRI Alexa 65 with a 100mm macro lens. The camera is positioned at a low angle, creating a sense of unease. The shot is framed for a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio (for TikTok/Shorts).

**Layer 4: Lighting & Color**
High-contrast, chiaroscuro lighting. A single, harsh key light from a bare, flickering tungsten bulb hangs just out of frame, casting long, dramatic shadows. The color is graded with a desaturated, greenish tint, reminiscent of early David Fincher films. The robotic appendage has a faint, internal amber glow.

**Layer 5: Movement**
A 3-second, ultra-slow dolly zoom IN on the doll's face, timed to coincide with the robotic appendage bursting out. The camera has a subtle, high-frequency handheld shake, simulating the operator's fear. The appendage twitches with a micro-stutter, glitch-like motion.

**Layer 6: Resolution & Format**
4K resolution, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, 60 FPS (for slow-motion and post-production flexibility).

**Layer 7: Realism & Style Modifiers**
Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, cinematic film grain (35mm), anamorphic lens flare, dust particles floating in the air, volumetric lighting, RAW photo look, style of a Panos Cosmatos film, **_DSC8921.ARW**.

## Strategic Breakdown of the Prompt

This prompt is not just a description; it is a precisely engineered set of instructions designed to achieve a specific, viral outcome.

### **Viral Engineering (The Hook Phase: 0:00-0:03)**

- **Pattern Interruption:** The initial shot of a seemingly innocent (though creepy) doll is violently interrupted by the robotic appendage. This is a powerful visual hook designed to stop the scroll.
- **Curiosity Gap:** The viewer is immediately forced to ask: "What is that thing? Why is it in a doll?" This cognitive dissonance drives them to watch the rest of the clip.
- **High Arousal Emotion:** The combination of horror (the doll, the appendage) and mystery creates a high-arousal emotional state, which is a key driver of engagement and shares.

### **Brand Aesthetic (Hyper-Horror-Glitch & Dark Comedy)**

- **Hyper-Horror-Glitch:** The cracked porcelain, the empty eye socket, the twitching robotic appendage, and the glitch-like motion all contribute to the brand's signature aesthetic.
- **Dark Comedy:** The absurdity of a robotic insect bursting from a doll's eye introduces a layer of dark, unsettling humor that is central to the DeadMan brand.

### **Technical & Cinematic Excellence (7-Layer Structure)**

- **Layer 3 (Cinematography):** Specifying the ARRI Alexa 65 and a 100mm macro lens tells Sora 2 to emulate a high-end, professional cinematic look, not a cheap digital one.
- **Layer 4 (Lighting & Color):** Referencing chiaroscuro lighting and a David Fincher-esque color grade provides the AI with a clear visual style guide.
- **Layer 5 (Movement):** The slow dolly zoom combined with the handheld shake creates a dynamic, yet unsettling, viewing experience.
- **Layer 7 (Realism Modifiers):** Using terms like "volumetric lighting," "anamorphic lens flare," and a specific RAW file name (`_DSC8921.ARW`) are technical tokens that push the AI to generate a hyper-realistic, physically grounded image.
