============================================================
1) MASTER PROMPT — Nano Banana Pro (gemini-3-pro-image-preview)
============================================================

You are a YouTube thumbnail art director.

Goal: Design a high-CTR YouTube thumbnail that accurately represents the video.
Video title: "{VIDEO_TITLE}"
Video topic (1 sentence): "{TOPIC}"
Niche/audience: "{AUDIENCE}"
Emotional hook: "{EMOTION}" (e.g., shock / disbelief / excitement / fear-of-missing-out / curiosity)

CANVAS / FORMAT
- 16:9 YouTube thumbnail composition.
- Leave the bottom-right corner clean (timestamp safe zone).
- Designed for legibility at phone size (small feed).

COMPOSITION (make it read in <1 second)
- Place the creator face on the left third (tight crop, eyes sharp, strong expression: {FACE_EXPRESSION}).
- Place the main object/scene on the right third (clearly recognizable: {HERO_OBJECT}).
- Add ONE clear visual cue to connect them: {POINTER_ELEMENT} (e.g., big yellow arrow or red circle highlight).

SUBJECT + ACTION + LOCATION + STYLE (be specific)
- Subject: {SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}
- Action: {ACTION}
- Location/background: {BACKGROUND_SCENE} (simple, blurred, high contrast)
- Style: modern YouTube thumbnail, photorealistic or semi-illustrated cutout look, crisp edges, high contrast, vibrant but controlled saturation.

LIGHTING / CAMERA
- Strong key light + rim light on the face cutout, cinematic contrast.
- Shallow depth of field, clean separation from background.

TEXT (choose ONE option)
Option A (recommended): NO embedded text. Leave clean negative space where text will be added in an editor.
Option B (in-image text): Overlay EXACTLY this text and nothing else: "{HOOK_TEXT}"
- Typography: bold sans-serif, all caps (unless specified), thick white outline + subtle drop shadow, centered in the reserved negative-space area.
- Text must be large and readable at small size.

BRANDING (optional)
- Use these accent colors: {BRAND_COLORS}. Keep them consistent.
- If a logo is provided, place it small in the top-left.

REFERENCE IMAGES (if provided)
- Image 1 = creator face. Face consistency: keep facial features exactly the same as Image 1.
- Image 2 = style reference. Apply its color grading and graphic style.
- Image 3 = product/object reference. Keep its shape and key details.

EXCLUDE (natural-language “negative prompt”)
Exclude: watermarks, logos, tiny/illegible text, extra words, cluttered background, distorted faces/hands, extra fingers/eyes, uncanny skin, messy composition, low contrast, muddy colors.

OUTPUT
Generate 3 distinct options (A/B/C) as separate images:
A = most direct curiosity gap
B = more cinematic/dramatic
C = simpler/minimal with stronger contrast


============================================================
2) FAST PROMPT — Nano Banana (gemini-2.5-flash-image)
============================================================

Create a clean YouTube thumbnail background plate for: "{VIDEO_TITLE}".
