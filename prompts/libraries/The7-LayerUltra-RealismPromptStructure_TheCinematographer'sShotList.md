# The 7-Layer Ultra-Realism Prompt Structure: The Cinematographer's Shot List

The **7-Layer Ultra-Realism Prompt Structure** is the core of the project's AI-enhanced production workflow, designed to achieve absolute hyper-detail and ultra-realism in video generation tools (like Sora 2). It functions as a **Cinematographer's Shot List**, providing the AI with technical metadata that grounds the output in real-world physics and camera science.

This structure is validated by external research as the correct approach for maximizing control and consistency in AI-generated video.

## The 7-Layer Prompt Structure

| Layer | Component | Purpose | Example Modifier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Subject & Action** | Core Narrative | Concise, active description of the main subject and its action. This is the "What." | `A lone figure in a heavy trench coat stands motionless in the rain.` |
| **2. Environment & Time** | Setting, Weather, Atmosphere | Detailed location, time of day, and specific atmospheric conditions. This is the "Where" and "When." | `A neon-drenched Tokyo alleyway at 3:00 AM. Heavy, wet snow is falling.` |
| **3. Cinematography** | Camera, Lens, Distance, Angle | Explicitly define the technical setup for a grounded, real-world feel. This is the "How it's Shot." | `Shot on an ARRI Alexa 65, 50mm anamorphic lens, low-angle close-up.` |
| **4. Lighting & Color** | Source, Quality, Grading | Crucial for realism. Use cinematic terms for light sources and color science. | `High-contrast, hard key light from a single streetlamp. Teal and orange color grading. Cinematic film grain.` |
| **5. Movement** | Camera Motion & Subject Motion | Define both the subject's action and the camera's movement (or lack thereof). | `Slow, deliberate 3-second dolly zoom out. Subject remains perfectly still.` |
| **6. Resolution & Format** | Technical Output | Specify output quality and aspect ratio for a professional look. | `8K resolution, 2.35:1 aspect ratio (cinemascope), 24 FPS.` |
| **7. Realism Modifiers** | Technical Tokens | Use specific tokens to mimic real-world sensor data and post-processing. | `RAW photo, hyper-detailed, photorealistic, **_DSC09421.ARW** (Sony RAW look), **Canon_RF50mm_f1.2LUSM** (for shallow depth of field).` |

## Complete, Ready-to-Use Example Prompt for Viral Content

This example is engineered for the "DeadMan // The Unseen" aesthetic (dystopian, glitch, high-contrast) and is designed to be used as a **Sora 2 B-roll layer** for a viral short (Clip Alchemist's workflow).

**Content Goal:** A 5-second, hyper-realistic, dystopian "glitch" transition to cover a jump cut, maximizing the **Pattern Interruption** hook.

### The Prompt:

> **A close-up shot of a pair of worn, gloved hands frantically typing on a vintage, glowing green CRT monitor keyboard.** The screen briefly flashes with a corrupted, pixelated image of a human eye. **Environment:** A dark, cluttered basement office in a 1980s brutalist building. Dust motes float in the air. **Cinematography:** Extreme close-up, macro lens, shallow depth of field (bokeh). **Lighting & Color:** Single, harsh overhead fluorescent light flickering. The only color is the toxic green glow from the monitor. **Movement:** Subtle, handheld camera shake. The monitor's image glitches and warps for exactly 1 second. **Resolution & Format:** Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio (for Shorts/Reels), 4K resolution, 60 FPS (for slow-motion capability). **Realism Modifiers:** Photorealistic, high-contrast, fine film grain, **Kodak Portra 400** color profile, **Leica Summilux-M 50mm f/1.4** lens look.

### Breakdown of the Prompt's Strategic Intent:

*   **Layer 1 & 2 (Subject/Environment):** Establishes the "DeadMan" aesthetic (worn, vintage, dark, brutalist).
*   **Layer 3 (Cinematography):** The **Macro Lens** and **Shallow Depth of Field** are technical instructions that force the AI to render extreme realism, focusing on texture (dust, worn plastic).
*   **Layer 4 (Lighting & Color):** The **Toxic Green Glow** and **Harsh Fluorescent Light** create the high-contrast, unsettling atmosphere necessary for the brand.
*   **Layer 5 (Movement):** The **1-second glitch** is the precise **Pattern Interruption** element, and the **Handheld Shake** adds realism.
*   **Layer 6 (Format):** **Vertical 9:16** and **60 FPS** are non-negotiable technical requirements for platform optimization and post-production flexibility (allowing for smooth slow-motion effects).
*   **Layer 7 (Realism Modifiers):** The use of **Kodak Portra 400** and **Leica** lens names are technical tokens that guide the AI toward a specific, high-fidelity, film-like texture, achieving the "Ultra-Realism" goal.
