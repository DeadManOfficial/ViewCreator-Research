Sora 2 Key Features
Native audio + lip-sync

Sora 2 generates dialogue, ambience, and sound effects perfectly synchronized with visuals - enabling complete scene beats directly inside your prompt.

Full audiovisual storytelling from a single text prompt.

Physics-aware motion

Actions like rebounds, balance, and mass behave more realistically than before - creating smoother, more believable continuity throughout a shot.

Natural physics for dynamic storytelling.

Multi-shot controllability

Maintain visual consistency and style across sequences. Sora 2 better persists world state between shot blocks for coherent multi-shot storytelling.

Create filmic sequences with stable world logic.

Professional prompt anatomy

OpenAI’s prompt cookbook now follows a cinematic shot-list format - including camera, lens, lighting, palette, action beats, and dialogue for full scene definition.

Structure prompts like a director’s storyboard.

API parameters for container control

Define model type (sora-2 / sora-2-pro), clip length (4 / 8 / 12 seconds), and resolution via the API - instead of burying settings inside prose.

Precise control over render and runtime configuration.

Cameos & social remix

In the Sora app, record a short self-clip to appear in your scenes or remix others’ videos - a new invite-based creative social experience.

Seamless personal cameos and remixable storytelling.

Practical Sora 2 Prompt Tips
#	Tips	Description & Examples
1	Use Camera Language to Tell Stories	In every sora 2 prompt, describe the shot type (wide, close-up, medium), camera movement (dolly, pan, tilt), and perspective (low, high, eye level).
Example: “Establishing wide shot, then dolly in to a medium close-up.”
This approach defines cinematic clarity in your sora 2 cinematic prompt.
2	Keep Physical Logic & Realism	Sora 2 understands physics - mention weight, friction, rebound, and realistic pacing.
Example: “Ball bounces off concrete, slows under friction, rolls to a stop.”
Ensures natural motion in your prompts for Sora 2.
3	Write Audio, Dialogue & Ambience	Use audio cues in your sora 2 prompt examples: “Ambient: soft city hum. Dialogue: ‘I waited too long.’”
Improves sync and storytelling for best sora 2 prompts.
4	Maintain Consistent Style, Color & Lighting	Fix 2–4 palette anchors like “teal & amber contrast” or “muted earth tones”.
Repeat them across all prompts for Sora 2 for continuity.
5	One Action Beat per Clip	Each sora 2 cinematic prompt should focus on a single action or emotion.
Split long stories into multiple prompts for clarity.
6	Optimal Prompt Length	Keep sora 2 prompts concise (~80–150 words).
Structure: subject + environment + camera + lighting + tone + optional audio.
7	Use Image or Reference Inputs	Upload reference images to lock faces, outfits, or background.
This ensures consistent style in best sora 2 prompts.
8	Iterate from Simple to Complex	Start with simple prompts for Sora 2 and remix progressively.

9	Design for Short-Form Video	Use “vertical framing” or “subject centered” for social formats.

It keeps all prompts for Sora 2 cohesive.
