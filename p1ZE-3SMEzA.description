DAY 100. We have arrived at the century mark. 💯

To celebrate this massive milestone, we are going absolutely nuke mode: a 10-Hour Marathon Stream. We aren't just shipping code today; we are testing human limits. I’ll be knocking out 1,000 Pushups and 250 Pullups throughout the stream while we vibe code the future of ViewCreator.

We are also testing the new GPT 5.2 live on stream. GPT 5.2 was released today at 1PM, and we are now testing it inside of Warp with codex. GPT 5.2 performs well on benchmarks, lower than Claude Opus 4.5, but we will give it a fair shake on stream.

We are deploying the ultimate stack for this marathon: Warp terminal, Cursor, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3.0 Pro. We are pushing production, refining our agentic workflows, and celebrating 100 days of consistency.

What is ViewCreator? ViewCreator is a production AI platform for creators and teams. It generates thumbnails, captions, carousels, and titles, and converts long-form video → shorts using our AI Clipping Agent. Our goal is to let creators schedule and post across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X, and LinkedIn from a single dashboard. Built on Next.js + NestJS + PostgreSQL on AWS.
