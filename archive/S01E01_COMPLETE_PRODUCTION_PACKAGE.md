# DEADMAN BROADCAST S01E01: THE SIGNAL HIJACK
## Complete Production Package

**Episode Type**: Series Opening / Intro  
**Duration**: 30 seconds  
**Status**: READY FOR PRODUCTION

---

## EPISODE OVERVIEW

S01E01 is the series introduction — the moment DEADMAN hijacks the airwaves and declares intent. This is not a pilot. This is a declaration of war against gaming industry corruption.

**Core Message**: "This is not a podcast. This is an extraction."

**Tone**: Cold, threatening, precise. Maximum authority, zero emotion.

## STEP 1: SORA 2 VISUAL GENERATION

### PRIMARY VISUAL: SIGNAL HIJACK (Loop A)

**Copy this prompt directly into Sora 2:**

```
Macro close-up of a customized radio broadcast console in a pitch-black room. A red "ON AIR" tally light flickers erratically at 2 Hz, casting harsh crimson illumination across scratched metallic dials and worn Bakelite knobs. Behind the console, a wall of vintage CRT monitors displays cascading green phosphor text and rapid binary code flashes. Camera: locked macro shot, 100mm equivalent lens, f/2.8 for shallow depth isolating the tally light with razor focus while monitors blur into ambient glow. Lighting: single harsh red key from tally light creating deep black shadows; cool cyan-blue fill spilling from CRT screens; high contrast ratio 20:1. Texture: dust particles visible in the red light beam, fingerprint smudges on chrome surfaces. Action beats: Light flickers on (beat 1) — holds steady (2 seconds) — double flicker (beat 2) — dims slightly (beat 3) — returns to full intensity.
```

**Generation Settings:**
- Duration: 10 seconds
- Quality: Maximum
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- Motion: Medium-High

**Generate 3 variations** — you'll loop and crossfade them.

### SECONDARY VISUAL: DATA STREAM (Loop D) - Optional Enhancement

**For the "We control the signal" line:**

```
Extreme close-up of a mechanical keyboard with RGB backlighting cycling through blue and purple hues. Fingers type rapidly in short bursts while holographic data streams flow upward from the keys, displaying fragmented text: "CLASSIFIED", "EMBARGO", "NDA BREACH". Behind the keyboard, three stacked monitors show scrolling terminal windows with white text on black background, IP addresses, and file transfer progress bars. Camera: macro close-up on fingers and keys, 85mm lens at f/1.4 creating bokeh on background monitors, slight handheld micro-shake for documentary realism. Lighting: RGB keyboard underglow as primary source (blue-purple gradient); cool white monitor spill as fill. Action choreography: Fingers strike keys in deliberate rhythm (beat 1: three keys) — pause half-second — (beat 2: rapid five-key sequence) — hands lift slightly — (beat 3: single emphatic key strike).
```

## STEP 2: VOICE RECORDING

### SCRIPT WITH TIMING MARKS

```
[0:00-0:03] — 3 seconds pure static — NO VOICE

[0:03] "This is not a podcast."
       Delivery: Compressed, distorted
       Emphasis: "not" gets subtle stress

[0:06] "This is an extraction."
       Delivery: Slight echo on "extraction"
       Emphasis: Drag the word slightly

[0:10] "The gaming industry is a crime scene."
       Delivery: Authoritative, cold
       Emphasis: Pause after "crime scene" for effect

[0:15] "And I'm here to bag the evidence."
       Delivery: Threatening whisper
       Emphasis: "bag the evidence" — sinister

[0:20] "They control the narrative."
       Delivery: Building intensity
       Emphasis: "They" is accusatory

[0:23] "We control the signal."
       Delivery: Peak emphasis
       Emphasis: "signal" is the power word

[0:26] "Stay paranoid."
       Delivery: Final command whisper
       Emphasis: Slower, quieter, more menacing

[0:28-0:30] — Harsh static cut to black
```

### RECORDING INSTRUCTIONS

**Before Recording:**
1. Read script aloud 5 times for rhythm
2. Mark your emphasis points
3. Test compression/distortion levels

**During Recording:**
1. Maintain consistent mic distance (4-6 inches)
2. Control breath sounds (minimize but don't eliminate)
3. Record 3 full takes minimum
4. Record 5 variations of "Stay paranoid"

**Character Notes:**
DEADMAN is not angry. DEADMAN is not scared. DEADMAN is certain. The threat comes from precision and knowledge, not volume.

## STEP 3: AUDIO PROCESSING

### PROCESSING CHAIN (In Order)

**1. Compression**
- Ratio: 8:1
- Attack: Fast (1-5ms)
- Release: Medium (100-200ms)
- Goal: Flatten dynamics, create "broadcast" sound

**2. Tube Saturation/Distortion**
- Mix: 20-30% wet
- Type: Warm tube saturation, not harsh digital
- Goal: Add grit without destroying clarity

**3. EQ**
- Cut: Below 80Hz (remove rumble)
- Boost: 2-4kHz range +3dB (presence/intelligibility)
- Cut: 8kHz -2dB (reduce harshness)
- Goal: Clarity through concrete walls

**4. Short Reverb**
- Type: Plate or small room
- Decay: 0.6-0.8 seconds
- Mix: 15% wet
- Goal: "Concrete basement" ambiance

**5. Final Limiter**
- Ceiling: -1dB
- Makeup gain: Aggressive
- Goal: Loud, punchy, broadcast-ready

### SOUND DESIGN ELEMENTS

**Static/Noise (0:00-0:03 and 0:28-0:30):**
- Source: Real analog static recordings
- Processing: High-pass filter at 200Hz
- Level: -12dB under voice when present

**Electrical Hum:**
- Frequency: 60Hz sine wave
- Level: Very low (-30dB), felt more than heard
- Continuous throughout

**Ambient Texture:**
- Cooling fan whir (low frequency)
- Intermittent electronic crackle
- Distant machinery rumble

## SERIES CONTINUITY NOTES

This episode establishes:
1. Visual language (red ON AIR, CRT monitors, broadcast aesthetic)
2. Audio signature (compressed whisper, 60Hz hum, static)
3. Verbal catchphrases ("Stay paranoid," "Here's the decrypt")
4. Pacing expectations (30s intro, 90s standard episodes)

All subsequent episodes should reference these elements for brand consistency.
