PROMPT 1: MOVIE THEATER DEATH SCENE
Format: 15 seconds, 1080p vertical (9:16), single continuous shot, 30 FPS
Horror movie theater interior, nighttime. Nonna being extremely disruptive during romantic film screening, eating messily, talking loudly. Audience slowly turns violent, attacking her. She fights back briefly before being overwhelmed. Crowd applauds.
Identity anchor:

Nonna—99 years old, white hair in tight bun stays same, thick black-framed glasses locked on face, deep facial wrinkles consistent pattern, floral dress (pink roses white background) with sauce stains appearing, weathered spotted hands holding fried chicken drumstick then wooden spoon as weapon, stocky 5'2" build proportions constant, annoyed then angry expression
Theater patrons (10 people)—mixed ages/genders, normal clothing, expressions shift from annoyed to murderous, holding various weapons (umbrellas, popcorn boxes, canes), proportions locked
Ghostface killer—white ghost mask same shape, black robe consistent, sitting two seats away from Nonna, annoyed body language, knife in hand unused

Camera rig: Static wide shot, 35mm lens, filming from back of theater row, no movement, no zoom, maintains full theater row in vertical frame, Nonna left-center, patrons surrounding, dramatic theater lighting from screen glow.
Temporal locks:

0-3s: Nonna eating chicken loudly, sauce on face and hands, slurping sounds, phone rings she answers loudly, patrons turning heads annoyed, Ghostface sitting still watching, movie screen glowing background
3-6s: Nonna yelling at screen in Italian waving chicken leg, old man behind taps shoulder asking quiet, Nonna turns points chicken at him yelling, flash photography from her phone, more patrons turning fully around angry
6-9s: Multiple patrons standing with weapons (umbrellas raised, cane lifted, popcorn box ready), Nonna pulling out wooden spoon defensively, Ghostface leaning back out of way, first patron swinging umbrella at Nonna
9-12s: Full melee—multiple patrons attacking Nonna simultaneously, she fighting back hitting with spoon, patrons overwhelming her with numbers, weapons striking, Ghostface still just watching annoyed
12-15s: Nonna slumped in seat defeated, patrons stepping back weapons lowered, entire group CLAPPING in unison, Ghostface joining applause, movie continuing on screen behind

Physics constraints: Theater seats stay grounded, chicken leg stays rigid until dropped, wooden spoon rigid weapon, umbrellas/canes maintain form during swings, contact impacts realistic, people maintain human IK during fight, no floating, Nonna's glasses stay on face, blood splatter minimal (comedic not graphic), 5 distinct fingers on all characters, weapons don't phase through bodies, patrons maintain individual proportions.
