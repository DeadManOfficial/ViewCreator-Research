# GitHub Investigation Findings

## Search Results Analysis
- **Direct Repositories:** No public repositories found for "ViewCreator.ai" or "ViewCreator" that match the AI content automation platform.
    - Matches found (e.g., `aharenchi/sample-laravel-viewcreator`, `umobi/UICreator`) are unrelated utility libraries or older projects.
- **BridgeMind Presence:**
    - Found a GitHub user profile referencing "Bridgemind ai east coast Canada" in followers lists (e.g., for Elixir/Phoenix orgs).
    - This suggests the founder or team might be using Elixir/Phoenix in their stack, or simply following those communities.
- **Matthew Miller:** No direct "vibe coding" repositories found under this name that clearly link to the ViewCreator codebase.

## Conclusion
- **Private Codebase:** ViewCreator.ai appears to be a closed-source, proprietary application. This is expected for a SaaS product in its early commercial phase.
- **Recreation Strategy:** Since we cannot access the source code, we must recreate the functionality based on **behavioral analysis** and **publicly available features** (as identified in the previous deep dive).

## Recreation Plan
We will build a **functional prototype** that mimics the core value proposition of ViewCreator:
1.  **AI Content Generation:** Use LLMs (simulated or via API) to generate scripts, captions, and ideas.
2.  **Dashboard UI:** A modern, "vibe coding" aesthetic dashboard (as seen in the landing page recreation).
3.  **Automation Workflow:** A visual flow for "Research -> Create -> Publish".
