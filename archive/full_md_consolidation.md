## 5. Strategic Workflows & Methodologies

### 5.1 The Holistic Brand System (Core Framework)

A comprehensive, three-phase approach to personal brand development:

**Phase 1: Clarify (Identity & Values)**  
Uses structured questioning to extract authentic brand essence, including:
- 6 Identity Questions (role, strengths, reputation, energy sources, career stage, headline)
- 5 Values Questions (core principles, boundaries, non-negotiables, creator code)
- 5 Audience & Positioning Questions (ideal viewer, platform mix, positioning statement)

**Phase 2: Synthesize (Strategy & Messaging)**  
Translates raw inputs into actionable brand assets:
- Positioning statements and taglines
- Platform-specific bios (professional, casual, playful)
- Content topic weighting and format definition
- Visual identity blueprints
- Engagement and growth strategies

**Phase 3: Create (Execution & Optimization)**  
Implements the brand system across all touchpoints:
- Content creation and publishing
- Visual asset generation
- Audience engagement and networking
- Performance tracking and refinement

### 5.2 The 6-Step Audience Expansion System

A data-driven workflow for strategic networking and community building:

**Step 1: Define Ideal Connection Profile**  
Create detailed criteria for ideal thought leaders/connections including topics, audience type, seniority, platforms, and red flags.

**Step 2: Generate Longlist (20-30+)**  
Systematically search platforms using keywords, hashtags, and "top voices" to compile 30-50 promising names with links and bios.

**Step 3: Score & Prioritize**  
Use AI (GPT) to score each person on topic fit, audience overlap, activity level, and values alignment (1-5 scale). Sort by total score.

**Step 4: Tier Assignment (A/B/C)**  
- **Tier A** (≥17 points): Core connectors, high fit, very active
- **Tier B** (13-16 points): Good fit, moderate-high activity
- **Tier C** (9-12 points): Interesting but less central

**Step 5: Smart-Follow System**  
Create platform-specific lists ("Core Connectors," "Amplifiers," "Emerging Voices") and turn on notifications for select Tier A connections.

**Step 6: Engagement Routines**  
- **Daily** (15-25 min): Comment on 1-3 Tier A posts, engage 3-5 Tier B posts, share 1 aligned item
- **Weekly** (45-60 min): Send 2-3 personalized DMs or newsletter replies, reference their work in your content
- **Monthly**: Review performance, adjust tiers, identify patterns, run experiments

### 5.3 The Brand vs. SEO Separation Strategy

A critical methodology for maximizing discoverability without sacrificing authenticity:

**Principle**: Separate brand clarity from SEO/algorithm optimization in public-facing discovery fields.

**Implementation**:
1. **Discovery Fields** (bios, titles, descriptions): Use keyword-dense, algorithm-friendly language with searchable terms and minimal profanity
2. **Content Itself**: Reserve authentic brand voice, edge, profanity, and controversial takes for the actual content
3. **Rationale**: Prevents algorithm throttling while maintaining brand authenticity where it matters most

**Example Application**:
- **Bio**: "Blunt AI news, internet drama, gaming & life rants. No-filter creator for 18-40 guys who hate fake positivity."
- **Content**: Full unfiltered language, aggressive honesty, provocative takes

### 5.4 The Visual System Blueprint

A structured approach to creating high-impact visual branding:

**Components**:
1. **Color Palette**: Define 3-5 core colors with specific hex codes and emotional associations
2. **PFP (Profile Picture)**: Specify emotion, framing, lighting, background, and click-maximizing elements
3. **Banner**: Define layout, text placement, visual hierarchy, and platform-specific dimensions
4. **Thumbnail Style**: Establish consistent template with face positioning, text style, and contrast levels

**Example Specification** (Aggressive Creator Brand):
- **Palette**: Black (#000000), Red (#FF0000), Orange (#FF6600), Green (#00FF00)
- **Vibe**: Dark, high-contrast, aggressive, unbothered
- **PFP Emotion**: Deadpan smirk, direct eye contact, slight condescension
- **Lighting**: High-contrast studio lighting, dramatic shadows

### 5.5 The Sora 2 Master Prompt Template

A professional-grade structure for maximum control over AI video generation:

```
[Style / Aesthetic]
Format description: aspect ratio, overall style, reference aesthetic

[Scene Description]
Who, where, what: characters, setting, key details

[Cinematography] – Camera, Light, Palette
Camera: framing, angle, movement, lens feel
Lighting: direction, quality, mood
Palette: dominant colors, accents

[Action Beats – Timeline]
0s–3s: [Single action + camera move]
3s–7s: [Single action + camera move]
7s–10s: [Single action + camera move]

[Audio / Dialogue] – Separate Block
Sound: ambient, effects, music
Voice: characteristics, accent, delivery
Dialogue: "Exact spoken lines"

[Character] (if using Cameo)
Character: @CharacterName – maintain consistency

[Remix Instructions] (for iterations)
Keep: [elements to preserve]
Change: [specific modifications]
```

### 5.6 The 6-Question Image Concept Framework

A systematic approach to generating brand-aligned visual assets:

1. **Subject / Concept**: What exactly should the image depict? (scene, subjects, key details)
2. **Visual Style**: What overall aesthetic? (minimalist, cinematic, editorial, surrealist, etc.)
3. **Format / Aspect Ratio**: What size and use case? (1:1 Instagram, 16:9 YouTube, 4:5 LinkedIn, etc.)
4. **Lighting Direction**: How should lighting feel? (soft natural, golden hour, moody dramatic, etc.)
5. **Mood and Emotion**: What emotions to convey? (confidence, authority, curiosity, warmth, etc.)
6. **Creative Constraints**: What to avoid? (stock photo look, clichés, busy backgrounds, etc.)

**Output**: Synthesized concept + AI-ready prompt + strategic rationale

**Category**: Industry History, Progress Critique  
**Duration**: 10 seconds

```
Photorealistic close-up of old gaming convention photo being held up, circa 2005-2010 era. Photo shows typical "booth babe" marketing: women in revealing costumes next to game displays, contrasted with awkward male attendee photos. Photo is being compared to modern convention photo (same company's booth): now showing women as presenters/developers, different tone. But document beneath modern photo reveals: internal memo about "booth personnel appearance guidelines" that's still uncomfortable. The progress is incomplete. Old photo shows yellowing with age, modern photo is crisp. Both are being arranged for comparison piece. Camera: Close-up of hands arranging photos on desk, 50mm lens, focus pulls between old and new photos, document partially visible beneath. Lighting: Warm desk lamp, photographs catch light showing glossy surfaces, shadows suggest late-night research.

## SECTION C: ANALOG HORROR COLLECTION (6 Prompts)

*Expanded French broadcast intrusion aesthetic with new scenarios.*

---

### HORROR-01: THE ANCHOR (Original Refined)

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Opens on authentic 1990s French television news set — Channel 7 "Info Sept" branding in lower third, timestamp showing 20:14. A composed female news anchor (40s, professional navy blazer, direct teleprompter gaze) reads evening bulletin under harsh 5600K studio lighting. At 3-second mark, signal corrupts: vertical hold slips 30%, static burst for 6 frames. Screen resolves showing the anchor unchanged, but now a second figure occupies the frame — a man in a distressed gray business suit standing motionless 2 meters behind her right shoulder, face partially obscured by datamoshing artifacts (P-frame corruption creating smear effect). The anchor continues reading, completely unaware. At 7-second mark, the figure's head SNAPS 90 degrees toward camera in 4 frames — movement stutters through artificial frame interpolation — creates 4 ghost images trailing the motion path. Anchor falters mid-sentence, eyes dart to floor monitor. At 11-second mark, the figure's mouth opens to physically impossible width (jaw appears unhinged), revealing pure VHS tracking distortion where interior should be — horizontal tear line oscillates across face. The anchor breaks character, whispers "Ce n'est pas dans le script" (This isn't in the script) — voice compressed through damaged audio codec creating artifacts. Final 2 seconds: Both figures FREEZE mid-motion as broadcast hard-cuts to EAS color bars, 1kHz emergency tone, screen text: "VEUILLEZ PATIENTER".
```

---

### HORROR-02: THE WEATHER MAP (Original Refined)

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Channel 6 "TéléSix" weather segment in progress, timestamp 19:47. Two presenters visible: male meteorologist (50s, gray suit, pointer in hand) and female co-host (30s, bright dress) gesture at chromakey weather map showing France with animated pressure systems. At 2-second mark, one studio fluorescent tube audibly pops (sound included), lights flicker. When illumination returns, a third figure has materialized: a field reporter in tan coat holding microphone marked "TéléSix", standing frozen at the edge of the weather map frame, facing AWAY from camera. Presenters continue without acknowledging. At 5-second mark, all three figures begin synchronized micro-movement — heads tilting left in perfect unison at 0.5 degrees per frame — creating stutter-loop echo effect as movement repeats. At 8-second mark, field reporter's head begins rotating through body — face passing THROUGH shoulder mesh like corrupted polygon model — completes impossible 360-degree revolution while body remains completely static. At 11-second mark, all three faces simultaneously turn to camera and MERGE into single kaleidoscope pattern — six eyes arranged in spiral, three mouths overlapping. Audio: original broadcast audio slows to 70% speed with pitch-drop, overlaid with subsonic 18Hz hum (viewer unease frequency). Final frame: broadcast resumes perfectly normal mid-sentence, presenters smiling, field reporter gone.
```

---

### HORROR-03: THE MEME (Original Refined)

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Channel 8 "Huit Direct" news hour, timestamp 21:03. Silver-haired male anchor (60s, authoritative presence, three-piece suit with pocket square) reports on economic policy. Lower third displays stock ticker scrolling left-to-right. At 3-second mark, screen divides without warning — picture-in-picture window opens in top-right showing grainy doorbell camera footage: an elderly grandmother waving at camera with exaggerated enthusiasm, absurdist internet humor style, completely tonal mismatch. Anchor pauses, confused, glances off-camera, attempts to continue. At 6-second mark, the doorbell footage grandmother FREEZES mid-wave — her image begins applying "deep-fried" JPEG artifacts to the main broadcast — oversaturation bleeds outward from PIP window into news studio — anchor's face shifts through green and red color channels in sequence. At 9-second mark, grandmother in PIP slowly turns head to face the main anchor THROUGH the screen — breaks dimensional barrier — her pixelated hand reaches OUT of the PIP window frame and makes contact with anchor's shoulder. Anchor flinches, breaking journalistic composure. At 12-second mark, both figures face camera directly — grandmother's smile has been COPY-PASTED onto anchor's face, perfect pixel match — creating uncanny valley effect. Audio: news theme distorts into chiptune melody, distant "Amogus" reverb. Final second: Anchor breaks fourth wall, defeated whisper: "Je ne comprends pas l'internet."
```

---

### HORROR-04: THE TEST PATTERN

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Opens on Indian Head test pattern (authentic 1950s design), 1kHz test tone steady. Timestamp in corner: 02:34 — dead of night broadcast. At 3-second mark, test tone begins wavering in pitch (subtle at first, then pronounced). At 5-second mark, the Indian Head image begins BREATHING — circular elements contract and expand slightly, geometric shapes pulse with organic rhythm. At 7-second mark, a hand slowly emerges from the center circle — reaching TOWARD the viewer through the screen — fingers stretching beyond test pattern boundaries. Hand appears to be composed of static itself, form shifting between frames. At 10-second mark, the hand STOPS, frozen inches from implied screen surface. A voice emerges from test tone (no visible source): "Nous t'avons vu. Nous arrivons." (We've seen you. We're coming.) — voice is multiple speakers in unison, slight delay between them. At 13-second mark, hand suddenly RETRACTS at impossible speed, test pattern snaps back to normal. Final 2 seconds: test pattern perfectly normal, but the Indian Head's eyes are now OPEN — they weren't before — staring directly at viewer.
```

---

### HORROR-05: THE GAME SHOW

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. French game show "La Roue de la Fortune" (Wheel of Fortune) style set, 1992 aesthetic. Contestant (woman, 30s, floral dress) stands at puzzle board, partially solved phrase visible: "BON_E N_IT" (Bonne Nuit / Good Night). Timestamp: 18:23. Studio audience applause (canned sound). At 3-second mark, contestant calls out a letter: "U!" — but the letter that illuminates is NOT U — the board displays: "AIDEZ-MOI" (Help me) in completely different puzzle. Contestant's smile doesn't change, rehearsed response. At 6-second mark, camera cuts to host (classic game show suit, practiced grin) who is looking directly at camera instead of contestant — his smile is too wide, unmoving while he speaks: "C'est correct!" (That's correct!) — audio/lip sync 3 frames off. At 9-second mark, puzzle board letters begin REARRANGING on their own — revealed letters sliding to form: "ILS NOUS REGARDENT" (They're watching us). Audience continues applauding, canned laughter. At 12-second mark, contestant's head slowly turns 180 degrees (neck rotating fully), face now pointed at camera upside down, smile maintained. Final 2 seconds: Static burst, broadcast resumes mid-episode, different puzzle, everyone normal.
```

---

### HORROR-06: THE DEAD CHANNEL

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Opens on channel that officially doesn't exist — Channel 13 "CANAL MORT" — snow and static filling frame. Timestamp: 00:00 (midnight exact). At 2-second mark, a broadcast emerges from static: a single figure sits in empty black void, facing camera. Figure wears 1960s style suit and tie, face completely in shadow despite no visible light source to create shadow. At 5-second mark, figure speaks directly to viewer (voice is backwards audio played forward, unsettling cadence): "Tu regardes l'écran depuis trop longtemps." (You've been watching the screen too long.) At 8-second mark, figure stands up and walks TOWARD camera — each step forward, video quality degrades — closer = more corrupted. At 11-second mark, figure's face finally enters light: it's the viewer's own face (implied by mirroring camera perspective, face is blurred/obscured but silhouette matches viewer's position). Figure raises hand, points directly at viewer. Final 3 seconds: Figure mouths words "C'est ton tour maintenant" (It's your turn now) — no audio. Static swallows image. Channel returns to snow, but a handprint now visible in the static pattern.
```

## SECTION D: VIRAL TEMPLATES (5 Prompts)

*Mind-bending shots designed for maximum scroll-stop impact.*

---

### VIRAL-01: THE GLITCH TRANSITION (Refined)

```
Photorealistic extreme macro of human eye reflecting screen content. Pupil dilates from f/2.8 to f/1.4 equivalent as reflection content GLITCHES — fragmenting into RGB channels, horizontal tear, datamosh artifacts. A single tear forms at inner corner, but instead of rolling down naturally, it pixelates at 8-bit resolution and dissolves into ascending data particles that float upward. The iris color shifts through unnatural spectrum sequence: electric blue → deep purple → warning amber → static gray → returns to natural brown but now contains scrolling code visible in iris texture. Catchlight in eye shows source screen clearly: DEADMAN BROADCAST logo flickers. Background: pure void black. Camera: 100mm macro, f/2.8, extreme shallow depth, locked tripod, subject eye fills 80% of frame. Lighting: single harsh blue-white source simulating screen, creates bright catchlight and rim light on iris edges, rest of face invisible in darkness. Color: skin tones desaturated, eye colors hyper-saturated during shift sequence. Duration: 10 seconds. Motion choreography: Beat 1-2: Normal eye, slight natural movement. Beat 3: Pupil dilation begins. Beat 4-5: Glitch occurs in reflection. Beat 6-7: Tear forms, pixelates. Beat 8: Data particles rise. Beat 9: Iris color shift sequence. Beat 10: Hold on final image with code visible.
```

---

### VIRAL-02: THE CORPORATE DECAY

```
Photorealistic medium shot of figure walking forward through pristine corporate hallway. With each step, the environment BEHIND the walker decays — walls crack, paint peels in time-lapse speed, LED lights transition to flickering fluorescent to exposed bare bulb to sparking wire. Carpet transitions from fresh to stained to torn to concrete beneath. The figure's reflection in passing windows shows DIFFERENT versions of themselves: one step shows them younger, next step shows them in different decade's clothing, next shows them elderly, next shows them as skeleton in suit. Walker maintains perfect forward focus with mechanical precision, never acknowledging transformations. Camera: Steadicam follow shot, 35mm lens, maintains constant 6-foot distance from figure's back, smooth continuous movement, NO CUTS, claustrophobic persistence. Color: foreground (walker) maintains consistent corporate neutral, background shifts from warm modern tan to cold institutional green as decay progresses. Final frames: figure approaches door marked "EXIT" — reflection shows door marked "NO EXIT" — figure pushes through, HARD CUT to white.
```

---

### VIRAL-03: THE INFINITE SCALE (Refined)

```
Continuous unbroken take through physically impossible scale changes. Opens on: a raindrop falling toward city pavement — camera SHRINKS, passing through water surface tension — now inside the droplet, city skyline reflected on curved interior surface — camera continues shrinking to molecular scale — water molecules visible as abstract shapes — PASSES THROUGH one molecule and emerges at human scale inside the reflected building from the droplet's surface — now inside an apartment where a CRT television displays news footage — camera PUSHES INTO the TV screen, passes through glass — emerges ON the news studio set — passes THROUGH the glass teleprompter — INTO the scrolling text itself — letters become massive architectural structures — camera navigates between sans-serif letterforms at building scale — exits through the period at the end of a sentence — period becomes a sphere, then a planet — camera pulls back revealing solar system — continues pulling back — galaxy — universe — the universe becomes a pixel on a screen showing the original raindrop falling. Seamless loop. Total: 10 seconds. Motion: constant fluid forward movement, speed varies (faster during scale transitions), never stops. No cuts.
```

---

### VIRAL-04: THE UNCANNY INTERVIEW

```
Photorealistic medium shot of generic corporate spokesperson giving interview. Everything is almost perfect: professional lighting, clean backdrop, confident delivery. But subtle wrongness accumulates: blink rate too slow (every 4 seconds exactly), smile micro-adjusts at regular intervals like refresh rate, skin has slight plasticity suggesting deepfake, eye contact with camera is TOO perfect (no natural drift). At 5-second mark, they glitch for 2 frames — same face but different hair color — continues seamlessly. At 8-second mark, audio and lip sync slip 2 frames apart — they continue as if nothing happened. Final second: they say "Have a wonderful day" but mouth clearly says "Help me". Freeze on final frame. Camera: Standard interview 50mm framing, locked tripod, professional but somehow wrong. Lighting: Three-point interview setup but shadows don't quite align correctly (subtle). Color: Oversaturated corporate blue in background, skin tones slightly too uniform. Motion: Minimal natural human movement, emphasis on uncanny stillness. Audio: (implied for video generation) voice has slight artificial compression throughout.
```

---

### VIRAL-05: THE DEVICE STACK

```
Photorealistic static shot of device stack showing screens-within-screens recursive nightmare. A laptop displays a phone, which displays a tablet, which displays a monitor, which displays a TV, which displays a handheld console, which displays a smartwatch, which displays a VR headset view. All screens show the SAME CONTENT: DEADMAN BROADCAST footage — but each smaller screen is 0.5 seconds BEHIND the larger one, creating temporal echo effect. The outermost device (laptop) shows footage of someone watching the same device stack — implying viewer is inside the recursive loop. Every few seconds, all devices GLITCH simultaneously but with different artifacts per device era (CRT static on TV, dead pixels on LCD, VR tracking loss).

## TIPS FOR FASTER PROMPTING

**Use Keyboard Shortcuts:**
1. Copy template letter (A-G)
2. Fill in ONLY your specific details
3. Keep style spine/color/audio foundation unchanged
4. Generate 3-5 variations

**Common Mistakes:**
- Over-specifying (let Sora fill some blanks)
- Under-specifying subject (be hyper-specific on key elements)
- Forgetting negative constraints (always add avoids)
- Skipping beatmap timing (actions need structure)

**Speed Tips:**
- Keep a file of your successful prompts
- Copy sections between related shots
- Use template quick-fills when appropriate
- Don't reinvent the wheel - adapt proven prompts

## File: DEADMAN_BROADCAST/DEADMAN_BROADCAST_SORA2_PROFILE.md

# DEADMAN BROADCAST: SORA 2 GENERATION PROFILE
## Dystopian 10-Second Analog Broadcast Shorts

**Version**: 1.0  
**Document Classification**: PRODUCTION CORE  
**Purpose**: Focused Sora 2 prompt architecture for DEADMAN BROADCAST aesthetic  
**Scope**: 10-second dystopian shorts with VHS/CRT/broadcast horror aesthetic

---

## PROFILE IDENTITY

**What This Profile Does:**
- Generates 10-second clips in the exact DEADMAN BROADCAST visual language
- Combines Sora 2's physics capabilities with analog degradation aesthetics
- Maintains consistency across the VHS/CRT/broadcast horror style
- Optimized for gaming industry exposé content

**What This Profile Does NOT Do:**
- General video generation (use standard Sora 2 guides for that)
- Long-form content (this is optimized for 10-second micro-content)
- Clean, modern aesthetics (DEADMAN is intentionally degraded)

---

## VISUAL DNA: DEADMAN STYLE ANCHORS

These elements MUST appear in every DEADMAN BROADCAST generation:

### The Immutable Core (Non-Negotiable)
```
AESTHETIC SPINE:
"VHS recording 1987, 480i resolution, visible horizontal scanlines,
tracking errors, chroma noise and color bleed, analog static texture,
oversaturated colors with magenta-cyan shift, tape wear artifacts,
broadcast television aesthetic, found footage quality"

COLOR PALETTE ENFORCEMENT:
- Signal Red: #FF2020 (ON AIR lights, danger accents)
- Phosphor Green: #33FF33 (CRT text, data streams)  
- Cyan Blue: #00FFFF (Monitor spill, digital elements)
- Warning Amber: #FFAA00 (Document highlights)
- Void Black: #0A0A0A (Deep shadows, 20:1 contrast minimum)

MANDATORY DEGRADATION:
- Film grain: 35mm scan quality, 20-25% opacity

## AUDIO DIRECTIVES

### The 60Hz Foundation

Every DEADMAN BROADCAST video MUST contain this electrical hum:

```
MANDATORY AUDIO BED:
60Hz sine wave (or 50Hz for European aesthetic), -40dB level,
subtle analog static texture layered at -50dB.

This creates the "always broadcasting" feeling and grounds
the analog aesthetic.
```

### Audio Zones by Shot Type

**Broadcast Console/Studio Shots:**
```
- 60Hz hum: -35dB (louder, more equipment)
- CRT electron hums: -40dB (multiple harmonics)
- Cooling fans: -40dB white noise
- Tape deck mechanisms: Mechanical clicks, motor whir
- VU meter needles: Subtle metallic flutter
- Switch/relay sounds: Mechanical clicks on state changes
```

**Document/Evidence Shots:**
```
- 60Hz hum: -40dB (standard)
- Paper rustle: Crisp, close-miked foley
- Finger on paper: Skin friction texture
- Page turn: Quick, decisive
- Minimal ambient (focus on evidence)
```

**CRT Monitor Shots:**
```
- 60Hz hum: -35dB (CRT is louder)
- Electron gun hum: Higher frequency harmonic
- Screen flicker: Subtle brightness modulation
- Hard drive: Clicking, seeking (if 1990s+)
- Keyboard: Mechanical if typing present
- Terminal sounds: Beeps, chirps for system events
```

**Surveillance/CCTV Shots:**
```
- Tape hiss: -30dB (prominent, VHS recording)
- HVAC: -40dB rumble (always present)
- Compressed/distant foley: All sounds muffled by low-quality mic
- NO music bed (authentic surveillance)
- Timestamp burn: No sound, visual only
```

**Corporate Office Shots:**
```
- HVAC: -35dB (loud in empty spaces)
- Fluorescent ballast: -45dB buzz
- Wall clock: -40dB ticking (oppressive in silence)
- Empty room reverb: Medium-long tail
- Occasional: Paper flutter from vent, distant phone ring
```

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Be HYPER-SPECIFIC about props: "wall calendar with red CRUNCH blocks"
- Detail equipment: "CRT monitors displaying green phosphor Courier text"
- Specify exact actions: "finger traces line reading 'MANDATORY OVERTIME'"
- Add unique identifiers: "coffee cup overturned, spilling onto calendar"

EXAMPLE BEFORE:
"Office with computer and documents"

EXAMPLE AFTER:
"Dark wood desk with single printed memo stamped 'CONFIDENTIAL' in red,
showing text 'LAYOFF PROJECTIONS Q4: 2,000 STAFF'. Coffee cup ring stain
on corner. Harsh overhead fluorescent creates hard shadow from paper edge."
```

---

### Problem: Duration Not Exactly 10 Seconds

**Symptoms:**
- Generated video is 9.8s or 10.3s
- Timing feels rushed or dragged
- Beatmap doesn't align

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Always end with: "Duration: 10 seconds exactly"
- Use beatmap with precise timing:
  H0.00 | B2.50 | B5.00 | B7.50 | E10.00
- Don't overfill with actions (max 3-4 beats per 10s)

POST-PRODUCTION FIX:
- Speed adjustment: If 9.8s → 102% speed, if 10.3s → 97% speed
- Trim to exactly 10.00s in timeline
- Verify audio sync after speed adjustment
```

# SORA 2: 2025 RESEARCH FINDINGS & EXAMPLE PROMPTS

**Classification**: RESEARCH REPORT
**Version**: 1.0 | December 2025
**Purpose**: Latest best practices, cutting-edge techniques, and comprehensive example prompts

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document synthesizes the latest Sora 2 prompting research from 2025, identifies gaps in current documentation, and provides 15 new high-quality example prompts across diverse use cases. Key findings include:

1. **Native Audio Generation** - Sora 2 now generates synchronized dialogue with lip-sync
2. **Character Injection (Cameo)** - "Upload Yourself" feature for consistent character appearance
3. **Advanced Physics Simulation** - Realistic motion with accurate rebound, momentum, and material properties
4. **Shorter = Better** - Two 4-second clips often outperform single 8-second clips
5. **Dialogue Formatting** - Must be separated into distinct blocks for proper lip-sync
6. **Shot-List Structure** - Most reliable results from layered, reusable prompt structures

---

---

## PART 2: 2025 CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Shot-List Layered Prompting

**What It Is**: Structure prompts in discrete layers you can tune independently

**Why It's Effective**:
- Allows targeted iteration without rewriting entire prompt
- Creates reusable "spines" for continuity across shots
- Separates technical specs from creative description

**Implementation**:
```
[STYLE SPINE - REUSABLE]
Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 4K DCI, 24fps, Kodak Vision3 500T emulation

[TECHNICAL LAYER - CAMERA]
85mm lens, f/1.4, shallow DOF, medium close-up

[ACTION LAYER - BEAT-MAPPED]
Beat 1 (0.0s): Subject enters frame left
Beat 2 (2.0s): Pauses, glances camera-right
Beat 3 (3.5s): Subtle smile appears

[LIGHTING LAYER]
Key: Soft window light camera-left, 5600K
Fill: Warm practical lamp, -2 stops
Ratio: 4:1

[COLOR LAYER]
Palette: Cream #F5E6D3, walnut brown #5C4033, soft amber #FFB84D
Grade: Lifted blacks, warm shadows, Portra 400 emulation

AVOID: Morphing, extra limbs, inconsistent lighting
```

**Common Pitfalls**: Mixing too many styles in one layer, contradictory specifications

---

### Technique 2: Dialogue Block Formatting

**What It Is**: Separate visual description from spoken dialogue using labeled blocks

**Why It's Effective**:
- Enables phoneme mapping for accurate lip-sync
- Prevents model from confusing visual cues with speech
- Allows tone/delivery descriptors

**Implementation**:
```
[VISUAL DESCRIPTION]
Medium shot, 90s documentary interview style. An elderly Swedish man
sits in a leather armchair in a wood-paneled study. Bookshelves
behind him. Soft window light from left. He looks directly at camera.

[DIALOGUE]
Man (calm, nostalgic): "I still remember when I was young."
```

**Advanced - Multi-Speaker**:

[VISUAL]
Two-shot at cafe table. Woman in blue sweater left, man in
gray jacket right. Afternoon light through window.

[DIALOGUE]
Woman (excited, leaning forward): "Did you hear about the discovery?"
Man (skeptical, raising eyebrow): "Which one this time?"
Woman (smiling): "The Mars samples. They found something."
```

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Lines too long (keep under 10 words for 4-second clips)
- Not specifying delivery tone
- Multiple overlapping speakers (model struggles with this)

---

### Technique 3: Shorter Clips Strategy

**What It Is**: Generate multiple 4-second clips instead of single longer clips

**Why It's Effective**:
- 4-second clips follow instructions more reliably
- Higher quality results per clip
- Easier to iterate on specific moments
- Can be edited together seamlessly in post

**Implementation**:
```
SHOT 1 (4 seconds):
Close-up of hand reaching for door handle.
Fingers wrap around brass knob, begin to turn.
Duration: 4s

SHOT 2 (4 seconds):
Door swings open, revealing hallway.
Camera dollies forward through doorway.
Duration: 4s

SHOT 3 (4 seconds):
Interior hallway, shadow moves across wall.
Camera holds as figure steps into light.
Duration: 4s
```

**Result**: Three reliable 4s clips = 12s total sequence with better control than single 12s generation

**Common Pitfalls**: Not planning for continuity (lighting, color, timing must match)

---

### Technique 4: Character Injection (Cameo)

**What It Is**: Pre-capture your likeness/voice, then insert into any generated scene

**Why It's Effective**:
- Perfect character consistency across multiple shots
- Accurate voice matching with lip-sync
- Eliminates AI face artifacts

**Implementation**:
```
[PROMPT WITH CAMEO]
My Cameo [NAME] is sitting at a modern desk in a bright office.
Wearing a navy blazer and white shirt. Looking directly at camera
with confident expression.

[DIALOGUE]
[NAME] (professional, warm): "Welcome to our new product launch.
Today we're revealing something revolutionary."

Camera: Static medium shot, 50mm, f/2.8
Lighting: Three-point setup, soft key from left
Duration: 4s
```

**Setup Requirements**:
1. Record 30-60 second video of yourself (multiple angles, expressions)
2. Upload to Sora 2 Cameo feature
3. Reference by name in prompts

**Common Pitfalls**: Requesting actions/clothing dramatically different from capture video

---

### Technique 5: Physics-Explicit Prompting

**What It Is**: Specify material properties and forces explicitly for realistic motion

**Why It's Effective**:
- Sora 2's physics engine responds to explicit material cues
- Prevents unrealistic floating/morphing
- Creates believable interactions

**Implementation**:
```
A regulation basketball (standard weight, medium elasticity)
is shot toward a regulation backboard from 15 feet. The ball
misses the rim, strikes the backboard with realistic impact
force, and rebounds at accurate angle downward, bouncing twice
on hardwood court floor (high friction surface). Each bounce
loses approximately 40% height. Ball comes to rest after third
bounce.

Physics: Realistic gravity (9.8 m/s²), accurate momentum
conservation, proper elasticity coefficient for basketball
(e=0.75), friction on hardwood.

Camera: Wide shot, locked tripod, captures entire arc
Duration: 8s
```

**Material Property Keywords**:
- Weight: "lightweight", "heavy", "standard weight", "massive"
- Elasticity: "bouncy", "elastic", "rigid", "deformable"
- Friction: "low-friction ice surface", "high-friction rubber", "slippery"
- Forces: "realistic gravity", "wind speed 20 km/h", "impact force"

**Common Pitfalls**: Vague descriptions like "natural physics" instead of explicit specifications

---

### Technique 6: Image Reference Input

**What It Is**: Provide a reference image to lock composition/style for first frame

**Why It's Effective**:
- Ensures consistent starting point across shots
- Maintains character appearance without Cameo
- Locks specific composition/framing

**Implementation** (API):
```python
response = client.video.generate(
    model="sora-2-pro",
    prompt="Character turns head slowly, smiles. Duration 4 seconds.",
    input_reference=open("reference_frame.jpg", "rb"),
    size="1280x720",
    seconds=4
)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-shot sequences maintaining character consistency
- Starting from specific art direction/storyboard frame
- Matching production design from concept art

**Common Pitfalls**: Reference image resolution doesn't match target size parameter

---

### Technique 7: Remix for Surgical Iteration

**What It Is**: Generate variation by changing ONE variable while locking others

**Why It's Effective**:
- Identifies exactly what's causing issues
- Prevents regression when refining
- Faster convergence to desired result

**Implementation**:
```
GENERATION 1 (Baseline):
Medium shot, woman in red dress walks through market.
50mm lens, natural daylight. 8 seconds.

RESULT: Good action, but lighting too harsh

GENERATION 2 (Remix - Lighting Change Only):
Same shot, same action, same red dress, same market.
Change: Add "overcast soft lighting" and "diffused shadows"
Lock: All other elements unchanged

RESULT: Perfect. Lock this version.

GENERATION 3 (Remix - Camera Change Only):
Same shot as Generation 2 (locked lighting).
Change: Switch from 50mm to 85mm lens
Lock: All lighting, action, wardrobe

RESULT: Better compression. Final version.
```

**Remix Strategy**:
1. Generate baseline
2. Identify single issue
3. Change ONLY that element
4. Compare results
5. Lock successful changes
6. Iterate on next issue

**Common Pitfalls**: Changing multiple variables simultaneously, losing successful elements

**Use Case**: Experimental visual, music video, art installation

**Prompt**:
```
Abstract macro cinematography, shot on Phantom Flex4K at 1000fps,
conformed to 24fps for extreme 41x slow-motion. Vibrant colored inks
(cyan #00B4D8, magenta #E91E63, golden yellow #FFD60A) drop into
crystal-clear water in glass container. Inks disperse, collide,
create organic fluid patterns.

Beat 1 (0-1s): Single cyan droplet enters frame top, suspended in air
Beat 2 (1-3s): Cyan droplet impacts water surface, creates crown splash
Beat 3 (3-5s): Cyan ink disperses downward in tendrils, billowing
organic shapes
Beat 4 (5-7s): Magenta droplet enters, collides with cyan, colors
begin mixing
Beat 5 (7-9s): Yellow droplet joins, creates three-color fluid dance
Beat 6 (9-12s): Colors swirl, mix at boundaries, create gradient zones
of secondary colors (purple, orange, green)

Camera: Locked macro shot, 100mm macro lens at f/8 for extended DOF
capturing full depth of fluid motion
Lighting: White LED backlight behind glass container creates luminous
glow through colored inks, side softbox for dimension on tendrils,
black background for maximum color contrast
Color: Pure saturated primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow), black
background #000000, glass container invisible (pure clarity), let
fluid mixing create secondary colors naturally
Grade: +40% saturation for vivid artistic look, high contrast,
deep blacks
Texture: Fluid dynamics - realistic ink dispersion physics, turbulent
flow patterns, billowing smoke-like tendrils, viscosity of water,
surface tension on droplets
Audio: No literal sound - suggest abstract synthesizer tones mapping
to color (cyan = low frequency drone, magenta = mid shimmer, yellow =
high sparkle), underwater acoustics

Duration: 12 seconds
Aspect: 1:1 (Instagram feed format)
Model: sora-2-pro (physics simulation critical)

AVOID: Text, symmetry (organic chaos), CGI plastic look, overly blurred,
frozen motion (must show fluid dynamics), clean separation (encourage
mixing), fast motion (defeats slow-mo purpose)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Extreme slow-motion reveals hidden fluid dynamics beauty
- Primary color collision creates visual interest through mixing
- Black background isolates colors for maximum impact
- Macro perspective creates abstract art from simple materials

saturation +10%, clarity boost for sharpness
Texture: Concrete texture detail visible, fabric movement on hoodie
during motion, motion blur on background at speed, sharp focus on
hands when planted
Audio: Heavy breathing (exertion), sneaker impact on concrete at
approach, hand slap on barrier, wind rush during vault, landing impact
(thud + grunt), continued footsteps, urban ambient (distant traffic)
Physics: Realistic vault physics - momentum conservation, realistic
body rotation, accurate landing impact with weight transfer, shoe
compression, barrier hand plant with realistic friction

Duration: 8 seconds
Aspect: 16:9 or 9:16 (vertical for social)
Model: sora-2-pro (physics precision critical)

AVOID: Unrealistic floating, teleporting, morphing body, locked camera
smoothness (needs action shake), slow landing (must show impact force),
perfect form (organic athlete imperfection), cinematic grading (keep
action sports natural)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- POV perspective creates immersive action experience
- Slow-motion reveals athletic technique and physics
- Ultra-wide lens captures hands, body, and environment

### EXAMPLE 7: EMOTIONAL CHARACTER - Grief Moment

**Use Case**: Dramatic narrative, character study, emotional storytelling

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on Sony VENICE 2, 6K full-frame, 24fps, Cooke S4/i 50mm T2 lens.
Medium shot, woman in her 50s sits alone at small kitchen table in
dimly lit room. Single window camera-right provides only light source
(soft overcast daylight 5600K). She holds a faded photograph in both
hands, staring at it.

Subject: Woman, salt-and-pepper hair in loose bun, wearing faded blue
cardigan over white shirt, reading glasses hanging from chain, visible
signs of age (wrinkles, age spots on hands), exhausted posture

Beat 1 (0-2s): Static hold, she stares at photograph, face neutral but
tense, shallow breathing
Beat 2 (2-4s): Her jaw trembles slightly (suppressing emotion), eyes
begin to water
Beat 3 (4-6s): Single tear escapes right eye, slowly tracks down cheek,
she doesn't wipe it away
Beat 4 (6-9s): Her shoulders drop (releasing held tension), eyes close
slowly, head tilts down slightly
Beat 5 (9-10s): Quiet held moment, tear reaches jaw line, photograph
still gripped in both hands

Camera: Locked tripod, absolutely still, observational distance
respecting private grief, eye-level neutral angle
Lens: 50mm at T2 (f/2), shallow DOF keeps her in focus while
background kitchen softly blurs, natural perspective
Lighting: Single source - overcast window light camera-right creates
soft wrap-around fill, ratio 3:1 (gentle contrast), no artificial
lights, shadow side of face visible but detailed, realistic interior
darkness
Color: Desaturated palette, blue cardigan #4A6FA5 (muted), white shirt
#E8E8E8 (aged), wood table #6B5744, photograph sepia tone #C4A574,
skin tones natural with slight cool cast from window light

gentle desaturation -20%, cool shadows, warm highlights, film print
emulation Kodak 5219
Texture: Realistic skin aging details (wrinkles, texture), fabric
texture on worn cardigan (pilling visible), wood grain on table,
faded photograph surface, 15% film grain for organic feel
Audio: Kitchen clock ticking (steady rhythm), distant muted traffic,
her shallow breathing (quiet, controlled), slight sigh at 6s, cloth
rustle from cardigan, profound silence emphasizing isolation

Duration: 10 seconds
Aspect: 2.39:1 (cinematic)
Model: sora-2-pro (subtle performance critical)

AVOID: Dramatic lighting, camera movement (stillness respects moment),
over-acting (subtle realism), music (silence is powerful), rapid tears
(realistic timing), makeup perfection (show real aging), brightening
scene (embrace darkness)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Static camera creates observational intimacy, doesn't intrude
- Single window light source creates natural interior realism
- Micro-expressions (jaw tremble, shoulders drop) show suppressed grief
- Realistic tear timing (one tear over 4 seconds, not dramatic cascade)
- Silence and ambient sound emphasize isolation and introspection
- Visible aging details create authentic character

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Subtle facial micro-expression rendering
- Realistic tear formation and tracking physics
- Natural skin aging texture (wrinkles, spots)
- Soft natural light simulation
- Quiet intimate audio atmosphere
- Emotional restraint (no over-acting)

**Expected Output**:
- Quiet, restrained emotional moment
- Visible aging details on skin and hands
- Single realistic tear forming and tracking slowly
- Soft window light creating dimension on face
- Photograph visible in hands (sepia-toned, faded)
- Background kitchen softly out of focus
- No dramatic music - clock tick and breathing only

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't add camera movement (static observational is powerful)
- Don't make tears flow dramatically (one slow tear is more realistic)
- Don't over-light the scene (embrace dim interior)
- Don't request "perfect skin" (aging texture is character)
- Don't add music (silence and ambient sound are emotional)
- Don't rush timing (grief moments need slow patient pacing)

leaf (reflective), viscous caramel sauce (liquid physics), steam rising
from hot sauce, ceramic plate matte finish, mint leaf visible veins
Audio: Quiet professional kitchen ambient, caramel pour (liquid stream),
gentle sizzle as hot sauce meets chocolate, subtle clink of tweezers on
plate, satisfied breath from chef (pride in work)
Physics: Accurate liquid pour (caramel stream viscosity, gravity flow),
chocolate melting from heat contact (realistic timing), steam rising
from temperature differential

Duration: 8 seconds
Aspect: 1:1 (Instagram) or 9:16 (Reels/TikTok)
Model: sora-2-pro (texture detail critical)

AVOID: Shaky handheld (needs locked culinary precision), dim moody
lighting (food must be bright and appetizing), rapid movements (chef
precision is deliberate), unnatural colors (food color accuracy is
paramount), frozen liquid (show physics of pour)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Overhead macro perspective shows culinary detail
- Slow deliberate movements communicate chef precision
- Practical melting chocolate effect demonstrates technique
- Visible tattoos humanize chef (not corporate perfection)
- Clean high-key lighting makes food look appetizing
- Liquid physics (pour, melt) add dynamic interest

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Macro detail rendering (gold leaf, mint leaf veins)
- Liquid physics simulation (caramel pour viscosity)
- Heat-based physics (chocolate melting from contact)
- Steam generation from temperature differential
- Material rendering (glossy chocolate, metallic gold, matte ceramic)

**Expected Output**:
- Pristine overhead culinary shot
- Sharp macro focus on plating area
- Realistic caramel pour with proper viscosity
- Chocolate sphere melting gradually from heat
- Steam rising from hot caramel
- Chef hands with visible tattoos showing human element
- White plate on marble counter (clean commercial aesthetic)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't add dramatic lighting (food needs bright even illumination)
- Don't rush movements (chef precision is slow and deliberate)
- Don't fake melting effect (must show realistic heat physics)
- Don't over-saturate globally (only food elements, keep whites clean)
- Don't hide chef hands (tattoos add authenticity and personality)

### EXAMPLE 9: ABSTRACT ART - Particle Simulation

**Use Case**: Music video, art installation, experimental film

**Prompt**:
```
Abstract digital art visualization, Unreal Engine 5 aesthetic, 8K
resolution. Millions of luminous particles (each particle 1-2 pixels,
emitting soft glow) form and reform in black void. Particles organized
into fluid geometric patterns that morph between states.

Beat 1 (0-2s): Particles scattered randomly in space, soft cyan
#00D9FF glow
Beat 2 (2-4s): Particles begin organizing into rotating double helix
structure, color shifts to magenta #FF00FF at helix core
Beat 3 (4-6s): Helix expands and transforms into spherical shell,
particles accelerate orbital motion, color gradient cyan exterior to
magenta interior
Beat 4 (6-8s): Sphere contracts rapidly into dense center point,
brightness increases (white core), particles pause momentarily
Beat 5 (8-10s): Explosive expansion - particles burst outward in all
directions creating supernova effect, color spectrum shift (cyan ->
magenta -> yellow #FFFF00 -> white), trails of light
Beat 6 (10-12s): Particles decelerate, fade gradually to darkness,
final sparkles extinguish

Camera: Virtual camera slowly orbits around particle formations
clockwise, 30-degree descent from high angle to eye level over
duration, smooth digital motion control
Lighting: Self-illuminated particles only (each emits own light), no
external light sources, glow intensity varies with velocity (faster =
brighter), black void background #000000 for maximum contrast
Color: Color transitions map to energy states - low energy cyan
#00D9FF, mid energy magenta #FF00FF, high energy yellow #FFFF00,
peak energy white #FFFFFF
Rendering: Volumetric glow on each particle (2-pixel halo), motion
blur trails during fast movement, depth-based particle scale (distant
particles smaller), particle occlusion (foreground particles block
background), bloom effect on bright clusters
Texture: No physical texture (pure light particles), digital perfection
(not organic), smooth gradients, prismatic light quality
Audio: Synthesizer soundscape - each particle emits sub-audible tone,
millions of tones create dense harmonic cloud, pitch maps to color
(cyan = 200Hz, magenta = 400Hz, yellow = 800Hz), volume maps to
particle density, silence during pause beat, dramatic bass pulse at
expansion, gradual fade matching visual

Duration: 12 seconds
Aspect: 16:9 (projection/display)
Model: sora-2-pro (particle count and physics critical)

AVOID: Organic textures (keep digital/synthetic), slow motion (particles
need speed), symmetry (embrace chaos within organization), static
camera (needs subtle movement), literal representation (pure abstraction)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Particle count creates visual complexity and depth
- Color transitions map to energy states (visual storytelling)
- Formation patterns (helix, sphere, explosion) provide structure
- Audio-visual synergy (pitch and color mapping)
- Pause beat before explosion creates anticipation
- Digital aesthetic embraces synthetic nature (not imitating organic)

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Particle system simulation (millions of particles)
- Physics-based motion (orbital, expansion, deceleration)
- Color gradient transitions
- Volumetric glow rendering
- Motion blur on fast-moving elements
- Audio generation with pitch/color mapping

**Expected Output**:
- Dense particle cloud formations
- Smooth morphing between geometric states
- Vibrant color transitions (cyan -> magenta -> yellow -> white)
- Motion blur trails during fast movement
- Explosive expansion with trails
- Gradual fade to darkness
- Synthesizer harmonic cloud audio perfectly synced

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't request "realistic" physics (this is abstract digital)
- Don't add symmetry constraints (chaos creates interest)
- Don't skip the pause beat (anticipation is crucial)
- Don't make color transitions gradual (should be state-based/sudden)
- Don't add literal objects (keep pure particle abstraction)

### EXAMPLE 10: DOCUMENTARY - Wildlife Behavior

**Use Case**: Nature documentary, wildlife content, educational

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on RED Komodo 6K, 120fps slowed to 24fps (5x slow-motion),
Sigma 150-600mm telephoto at 400mm f/5.6. Medium-long shot, adult male
kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) perched on weathered wooden branch
overhanging calm pond. Natural behavior sequence: alert scanning, dive,
catch, return.

Subject: Common kingfisher, brilliant blue plumage #0066CC with orange
chest #FF6B35, compact body, prominent black beak, black legs gripping
branch, natural wild posture (not posed)

Beat 1 (0-2s): Kingfisher perched, head turning left-right scanning
water surface below, body still, alert posture
Beat 2 (2-3s): Body tenses, head locks position (spotted prey), slight
crouch preparing to dive
Beat 3 (3-5s): Explosive launch from branch, wings snap open,
headfirst dive toward water, trajectory arc toward surface
Beat 4 (5-7s): Beak breaks water surface (small splash), submerged
briefly (0.3 seconds), emerges with small fish in beak
Beat 5 (7-9s): Wings beat rapidly (water droplets flying from
feathers), ascending back toward perch
Beat 6 (9-10s): Lands on branch (slight bounce, weight settling), fish
still in beak, satisfied posture

Camera: Locked telephoto on tripod (wildlife videography standard),
300mm+ compression creates depth, slight telephoto breathing when bird
moves toward/away, manual focus tracks bird throughout action
Lighting: Natural overcast daylight 6000K (even soft shadows ideal for
wildlife), water surface reflects skylight, no artificial lights,
preserving natural environment
Color: Natural wildlife palette - kingfisher blue #0066CC (iridescent
quality), orange chest #FF6B35, weathered branch brown #6B5744, pond
water olive green #5C6B3B with sky reflection, background bokeh green
#7A9D54 (foliage out of focus)
Grade: Natural documentary color, minimal intervention, slight
saturation boost +10% on bird plumage only (showcase natural beauty),
neutral shadows and highlights
Texture: Detailed feather texture (barbules visible in closeup), water
droplets on feathers after emergence (surface tension), weathered wood
grain on branch, ripples on pond surface from dive, motion blur on
wings during rapid beat
Audio: Quiet pond ambient (subtle water laps, distant wind in reeds),
kingfisher chirp before dive (high-pitched alert call), splash on
water entry (small crisp impact), wing beats (rapid flutter), droplets
falling from feathers back to water
Physics: Accurate bird flight dynamics (wing loading, takeoff physics),
realistic water splash (size appropriate for small bird), water
droplets obeying gravity as they fall from feathers, branch slight
bounce from landing weight

Duration: 10 seconds
Aspect: 16:9 (documentary standard)
Model: sora-2-pro (wildlife detail and physics critical)

AVOID: Staged behavior (must be natural), artificial lighting (preserve
documentary authenticity), exaggerated slow-motion (5x is realistic),
overly dramatic music (natural sound is powerful), clean water (natural
pond has organic matter), perfect focus throughout (telephoto has
natural DOF)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Telephoto compression creates cinematic wildlife aesthetic
- Slow-motion reveals rapid behavior impossible to see in real-time
- Natural behavior sequence tells complete hunting story
- Authentic wildlife audio (bird call, splash, wing beats)
- Locked camera respects documentary observation conventions
- Natural lighting preserves authenticity

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Detailed animal rendering (feather barbules visible)
- Complex physics (flight dynamics, water splash, droplet motion)
- Natural behavior animation (not anthropomorphized)
- Environmental interaction (bird-water-branch)
- Wildlife audio generation (species-accurate call)

**Expected Output**:
- Sharp focus on kingfisher with telephoto compression
- Natural wild bird posture and behavior
- Realistic dive trajectory and water entry splash
- Visible water droplets on feathers after emergence
- Rapid wing beats (motion blur appropriate for speed)
- Background foliage softly blurred (telephoto bokeh)
- Natural pond environment (organic matter visible)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't make bird look at camera (wild animals avoid eye contact)
- Don't create Disney-style anthropomorphic expressions
- Don't use pristine blue water (natural pond is organic/murky)
- Don't add dramatic music (natural sound is documentary standard)
- Don't make splash too large (kingfisher is small bird)
- Don't request perfect flight (natural birds have slight imperfections)

### EXAMPLE 11: HORROR - Psychological Tension

**Use Case**: Horror short, thriller, suspense content

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on Blackmagic URSA Mini 4.6K, 24fps, Zeiss CP.2 35mm T2.1. Wide
shot, empty suburban hallway at night, single practical light source
(table lamp visible in frame end of hall) casts long shadows. Camera
static, locked low angle (2 feet off ground looking down hallway).

Environment: Residential hallway, dated 1980s wallpaper (floral
pattern, faded), dark hardwood floor, family photos on walls barely
visible in darkness, door frames flanking hallway (all doors closed),
dust visible in light beam

Beat 1 (0-3s): Completely still, empty hallway, only lamp glow, silence
Beat 2 (3-4s): Lamp flickers once (0.2 seconds to darkness then back
on), shadow pattern shifts
Beat 3 (4-7s): Hold on stillness, nothing happens (building tension
through absence)
Beat 4 (7-8s): Subtle shadow movement at far end of hall (barely
perceptible, not clearly defined)
Beat 5 (8-9s): Lamp dims slightly (10% reduction), shadows deepen
Beat 6 (9-10s): Hold on ambiguous moment - is something there?

Camera: Locked low-angle tripod, absolute zero movement, creates
child's eye level perspective (vulnerability), wide lens includes floor
(potential for something entering frame)
Lighting: Single practical source (table lamp, warm 2700K tungsten),
harsh contrast ratio 30:1, deep black shadows, no fill light, darkness
dominates frame (70% of image in shadow), motivated light only
Color: Desaturated horror palette -40%, warm lamp glow #FFA500
(isolated warmth), cool blue-black shadows #0D1B2A, faded wallpaper
muted tones, darkness is protagonist
Grade: Crushed blacks at 0% (pure black shadows), low saturation, cool
color temperature in shadows, slight green cast #2C3E2A in mid-tones
(sickly), film grain 25% for texture and unease
Texture: Visible film grain creates visual noise (uncertainty), dust
particles floating in light beam (something is present, just not
visible), wallpaper texture shows age, wood floor reflects lamp dimly
Audio: House settling creaks (old wood), distant traffic muted,
refrigerator hum from elsewhere (60Hz), complete silence at 4-7s beat
(the absence is terrifying), lamp bulb slight buzz, no music (silence
is the horror)

Duration: 10 seconds
Aspect: 2.39:1 (widescreen increases isolation)
Model: sora-2-pro (subtle shadow movement critical)

AVOID: Jump scares (build slow tension), revealed entity (ambiguity is
terrifying), camera movement (stillness is oppressive), score/music
(silence is horror), fast pacing (dread requires patience), brightness
(darkness is where horror lives), clean modern home (dated setting adds
unease)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Static low-angle camera creates vulnerability and anticipation
- Single light source creates deep shadows (unknown spaces)
- Long silent hold (4-7s) builds tension through absence
- Ambiguous shadow movement (never clearly defined entity)
- Lamp flicker and dimming suggests presence without revealing
- Dated environment (1980s) adds uncanny familiarity

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- High contrast lighting simulation (ratio 30:1)
- Subtle shadow animation (barely perceptible movement)
- Practical light behavior (flicker, dimming)
- Atmospheric particle rendering (dust in beam)
- Silence and ambient sound design (house creaks, hum)

**Expected Output**:
- Mostly dark frame with single pool of warm light
- Long shadows stretching down hallway
- Single lamp flicker event (brief darkness)
- Ambiguous shadow movement (questionable - did you see it?)
- No revealed entity (maintain ambiguity)
- Oppressive silence with house settling sounds
- Dated wallpaper visible in dim light

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't reveal the threat (ambiguity is scarier)
- Don't add jump scares or loud stingers (cheap horror)
- Don't move camera (static observation is more tense)
- Don't brighten shadows (darkness is where horror exists)
- Don't add music (silence and ambient are more unsettling)
- Don't make shadow movement obvious (subtle = creepier)

### EXAMPLE 12: COMMERCIAL - Fashion Editorial

**Use Case**: Fashion film, brand campaign, editorial content

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on ARRI Alexa Mini LF, 4K open-gate 4:3 aspect, 48fps slowed to
24fps (2x slow-motion), Leica Summilux 75mm f/1.4 shot wide open.
Medium shot, fashion model (female, late 20s, 5'10", angular features,
slicked-back hair) walks toward camera down minimal concrete corridor.
High fashion editorial aesthetic.

Subject: Model wearing oversized charcoal gray wool coat, structured
shoulders, black turtleneck underneath, wide-leg black trousers,
minimal silver jewelry (thin hoop earrings), natural makeup, confident
powerful stride

Beat 1 (0-2s): Model distant in frame, small against minimalist
architecture, begins approach
Beat 2 (2-4s): Steady stride toward camera, coat flows with movement
physics (wool weight), shoulders create strong silhouette
Beat 3 (4-6s): Camera operator walks backward maintaining distance
(floating Steadicam move), model's expression shifts from neutral to
slight knowing smirk
Beat 4 (6-8s): Now medium shot, coat movement visible (fabric
billowing slightly with stride), direct eye contact with lens (modeling
confidence)

Camera: Steadicam backward dolly, smooth floating motion, maintains
constant distance from subject as she approaches, slight vertical
breathing room (human operator subtlety), 75mm portrait compression
Lens: Leica Summilux 75mm at f/1.4 (maximum aperture), razor-thin DOF
isolates subject, background concrete corridor blurs into abstract
vertical lines, creamy bokeh quality, slight focus breathing adds
organic quality
Lighting: Architectural daylight from ceiling skylights creates top
light with soft graduated shadows down body, cool 6500K color
temperature, no artificial fill (embrace shadow contrast), ratio 8:1,
minimalist beauty
Color: Monochromatic fashion palette - charcoal gray #36454F coat,
black #1A1A1A clothing, concrete #B0B0B0 environment, cool silver
#C0C0C0 jewelry, skin tones natural with cool cast, minimal color
distraction from form and silhouette
Grade: High-fashion editorial grading - lifted blacks to 15%,
desaturated -30%, cool temperature shift, increased midtone contrast
+20%, film print emulation with slight green cast in shadows, matte
finish (non-glossy aesthetic)
Texture: Wool coat texture visible (fabric weave), concrete raw finish
(imperfections, form marks), 10% fine grain for editorial aesthetic
(not clean digital), hair texture (product shine visible), skin natural
(no smoothing - editorial celebrates real texture)
Audio: Echoing footsteps in concrete space (reverb, authority), subtle
fabric rustle from coat movement, minimal ambient (warehouse quiet),
no music (let visuals and stride rhythm create pacing), breathing
barely audible

Duration: 8 seconds
Aspect: 4:3 (editorial portrait format)
Model: sora-2-pro (fabric physics and bokeh critical)

AVOID: Overly colorful (minimal palette is fashion editorial), smiling
(editorial is serious/powerful), busy background (minimalism is key),
flat lighting (shadows create dimension), smooth digital look (grain
adds editorial texture), hair movement in wind (controlled styling),
music (fashion confidence is silent)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Steadicam backward dolly creates elegant fashion film movement
- Shallow DOF (f/1.4) isolates subject with creamy bokeh
- Monochromatic palette focuses attention on form and silhouette
- Coat fabric physics add natural movement
- Architectural minimal setting doesn't compete with fashion
- Direct eye contact creates confident powerful presence

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Fabric physics simulation (wool coat weight and drape)
- Shallow depth of field with premium bokeh rendering
- Smooth camera motion (Steadicam float)
- Architectural lighting (top-down gradation)
- Material textures (wool weave, concrete, skin)

**Expected Output**:
- Elegant floating camera backward move
- Subject sharp with background completely blurred
- Charcoal wool coat flowing naturally with stride
- Minimal concrete corridor (vertical lines in bokeh)
- Cool architectural lighting from above
- Model expression transitions (neutral -> knowing smirk)
- Echoing footsteps in minimal space

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't add bright colors (editorial is minimal monochrome)
- Don't make model smile broadly (editorial is serious/powerful)
- Don't use busy background (clean minimal architecture)
- Don't flatten lighting (shadows create editorial dimension)
- Don't smooth skin digitally (editorial celebrates real texture)
- Don't add music (confident stride rhythm is the soundtrack)

### EXAMPLE 13: TUTORIAL - Process Demonstration

**Use Case**: Educational content, how-to video, skill demonstration

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on Sony A7S III, 4K 24fps, Sony 90mm f/2.8 Macro. Overhead shot,
clean white desk surface. Hands (female, wearing simple white long-
sleeve shirt, no jewelry, short natural nails) demonstrate basic
origami crane folding process step-by-step.

Beat 1 (0-2s): Hands place square origami paper (15cm, bright red
#E53935) flat on desk, smooth it out
Beat 2 (2-4s): Fold paper diagonally corner-to-corner, crease firmly
with thumbnail, creating triangle
Beat 3 (4-6s): Unfold, rotate 90 degrees, fold opposite diagonal,
crease
Beat 4 (6-8s): Unfold showing X crease pattern, fold in half
horizontally, crease
Beat 5 (8-10s): Unfold, fold vertically, crease - showing grid pattern
Beat 6 (10-12s): Hands pause showing completed foundation creases,
ready for next steps

Camera: Locked overhead tripod, 90-degree top-down view, centered
composition keeps hands and paper in frame throughout
Lens: 90mm macro at f/5.6 (sufficient DOF for hands and paper both
sharp), captures fine detail of paper texture and crease lines
Lighting: Soft diffused overhead LED panel (5600K) creates even
shadowless illumination, white bounce cards left and right eliminate
harsh shadows, tutorial-friendly bright clean lighting
Color: Pure white desk #FFFFFF, bright red origami paper #E53935, skin
tones natural, white shirt sleeves #F5F5F5, high-key minimal palette
Grade: Bright tutorial aesthetic, lifted shadows, clean whites without
clipping, natural color, +10% clarity for instructional sharpness, no
stylistic grading (educational clarity priority)
Texture: Paper fiber texture visible, crease lines sharp and defined,
skin texture natural (no smoothing), fabric texture on shirt sleeves,
desk surface matte clean
Audio: Paper folding sounds (crisp fold, thumbnail crease scrape),
quiet workspace ambient, no music (sounds of process are instructional),
gentle breathing (focused work), satisfying ASMR-friendly crisp paper
sounds
Physics: Accurate paper folding physics (crease formation, paper
tension, finger pressure creates defined fold lines), paper doesn't
float or morph, hands move at natural instructional pace (not rushed,
pedagogical timing)

Duration: 12 seconds
Aspect: 1:1 (Instagram tutorial) or 9:16 (TikTok vertical)
Model: sora-2 (tutorial clarity more important than pro rendering)

AVOID: Dramatic lighting (needs flat even illumination), fast
movements (tutorial must be followable), shaky handheld (overhead must
be stable), cluttered desk (minimize distractions), unnatural hand
movements (realistic instructor pacing), background music (paper sounds
are ASMR content)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Overhead perspective provides clear view of process
- Deliberate pedagogical pacing allows viewer to follow
- Clean minimal aesthetic eliminates distractions
- Even flat lighting ensures all details visible
- ASMR-friendly paper folding sounds enhance experience
- Hands-only framing keeps focus on technique

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:

### EXAMPLE 14: EXPERIMENTAL - Time Manipulation

**Use Case**: Artistic short, experimental film, music video

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on RED Komodo 6K, 24fps with mixed-speed footage composited. Split
composition: left half normal time, right half frozen moment. Urban
street scene, cyclist passes through frame.

Left half (normal 24fps):
- Busy city street, people walking, cars moving, cyclist approaching
- Natural motion continues throughout duration
- Real-time environmental activity

Right half (frozen time):
- Exact same scene but time completely frozen at 3-second mark
- Cyclist mid-motion (frozen lean, suspended balance)
- Pedestrian mid-stride (foot off ground)
- Car wheels not rotating
- Water droplet suspended in air from puddle splash
- Everything perfectly still while left continues

Beat 1 (0-3s): Both halves moving normally, identical scenes
Beat 2 (3.0s): Right half freezes instantly, left continues
Beat 3 (3-8s): Left half - cyclist exits frame, new people enter,
life continues. Right half - frozen tableau holds static
Beat 4 (8-9s): Camera slowly pushes in on both halves (dolly forward)
Beat 5 (9-10s): Right half unfreezes, motion resumes, both halves sync
again

Camera: Locked tripod for consistency, subtle dolly-in on beat 4
(8-inch push over 2 seconds), split-screen must maintain perfect
alignment
Lighting: Overcast urban daylight 6000K, natural street lighting,
ensure both halves match exactly in exposure and color
Color: Urban palette - gray asphalt #6B6B6B, brick buildings #A0522D,
cyclist blue jacket #1976D2, car red #D32F2F, natural skin tones,
desaturated urban aesthetic -15%
Grade: Match both halves precisely, slight cool cast, urban
contemporary look, ensure frozen half doesn't look like photograph
(maintains video characteristics just motionless)
Texture: Urban environmental detail - wet street reflections, brick
texture, fabric on cyclist, water droplet suspended (surface tension
visible), motion blur in left half on moving elements, sharp frozen
clarity in right half
Audio: Left half - continuous city ambient (traffic, footsteps,
voices), Right half - audio fades to silence at freeze then distant
muffled version (underwater effect), split audio mirrors visual split,
subtle electronic transition sound at freeze moment

Duration: 10 seconds
Aspect: 16:9 or 2.39:1 (cinematic)
Model: sora-2-pro (complex time manipulation critical)

AVOID: Blurred frozen half (must be sharp), mismatched halves
(lighting/color must be identical), smooth transition (freeze should be
instant), CGI artificial look (maintain photorealistic urban aesthetic),
busy composition (needs clear split visibility)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Split-screen time manipulation creates philosophical visual
- Contrast between motion and stillness is striking
- Precise freeze moment captures mid-motion suspension (cyclist lean)
- Audio split mirrors visual split (full ambient vs muffled silence)
- Dolly-in draws attention to frozen details
- Re-sync at end provides satisfying resolution

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Complex time manipulation (frozen vs real-time)
- Physics suspension (cyclist balance, water droplet, foot off ground)
- Precise split-screen composition alignment
- Audio-visual synchronization with split characteristics
- Dolly motion maintains split alignment

**Expected Output**:
- Clean vertical split down center frame
- Left half: continuous urban motion and activity
- Right half: perfectly frozen tableau at 3s mark
- Cyclist frozen mid-lean (balanced impossibly)
- Pedestrian frozen mid-stride (foot suspended)
- Water droplet frozen in air
- Dolly-in reveals frozen details
- Audio fades to muffled on right half
- Re-sync at 9s brings both halves back to motion

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't blur frozen half (defeats the frozen moment clarity)
- Don't mismatch lighting between halves (must be identical scenes)
- Don't make freeze gradual (instant freeze is impactful)
- Don't lose split alignment during dolly-in (technical precision)
- Don't use artificial CGI aesthetic (maintain photorealistic urban)

### EXAMPLE 15: SOCIAL MEDIA - Vertical Format Hook

**Use Case**: TikTok, Instagram Reels, short-form vertical content

**Prompt**:
```
Shot on iPhone 15 Pro, vertical 9:16 format, 4K 60fps. Rapid energetic
cutting, young creator (female, early 20s, casual style) does direct-
to-camera talking head with dynamic hand gestures and expression
changes. High-energy social media aesthetic.

Subject: Creator, denim jacket over graphic tee, natural makeup, hair
in messy bun, standing in bedroom with LED strip lights visible on
wall behind (purple and blue #9B59B6 #3498DB)

Beat 1 (0-1s): Straight to camera, eyebrows raised, big opener
expression
Beat 2 (1-2s): Hand gesture emphasizing point (counts on fingers)
Beat 3 (2-3s): Head tilt with knowing smile (relatable moment)
Beat 4 (3-4s): Excited expression, both hands up (emphatic gesture)

Dialogue:
Creator (energetic, authentic): "Okay so here's the thing nobody tells
you about [topic]. First—" [counts on finger] "you're gonna mess it up.
Second—" [another finger] "that's totally fine. And third—" [both hands
up, big smile] "that's literally how you learn!"

Camera: Handheld phone POV, slight organic shake (holding phone at
arm's length), vertical composition with creator centered, slight
subtle zoom-in over duration (common TikTok technique, 10% scale push)
Lighting: Bedroom natural window light from side (soft daylight) mixed
with RGB LED strip lights behind creating purple/blue glow halo effect,
front-facing phone screen provides subtle fill light on face (common
selfie lighting)
Color: Vibrant social media aesthetic, purple LED #9B59B6, blue LED
#3498DB, denim blue #5DADE2, natural skin tones, colorful graphic tee,
saturated punchy colors +20%
Grade: Bright high-energy social media look, lifted blacks, punchy
contrast, slight warm filter (+300K), clarity boost for sharpness,
"Valencia" Instagram filter aesthetic
Texture: Slight motion blur from handheld phone, LED light bloom,
fabric texture on denim, hair texture (natural not perfect), minimal
grain (clean digital phone sensor)
Audio: Direct voice (phone mic quality, slight proximity effect), room
reverb from bedroom, authentic casual vocal delivery (not overly
produced), natural speech patterns with filler words (um, like), subtle
background ambient (bedroom quiet)

Duration: 4 seconds (TikTok/Reels optimal length)
Aspect: 9:16 (vertical)
Model: sora-2 (speed and lip-sync more important than pro quality)

AVOID: Perfect studio lighting (needs authentic bedroom creator
aesthetic), overly polished delivery (authenticity is key), locked
tripod (handheld phone shake is format convention), slow pacing
(social media is rapid), muted colors (needs vibrant energy), perfect
environment (lived-in bedroom is relatable)
```

**What Makes It Effective**:
- Direct eye contact with camera creates connection
- Rapid pacing matches short-form attention span
- Hand gestures and expressions add visual dynamism
- Authentic bedroom setting is relatable creator aesthetic
- RGB LED lights signal Gen Z creator production value
- Natural speech patterns (not scripted corporate)

**Sora 2 Features Leveraged**:
- Lip-sync for direct-to-camera dialogue
- Natural facial micro-expressions and gestures
- Handheld phone camera shake simulation
- RGB LED glow effects (purple/blue halo)
- Authentic vocal delivery with phone mic characteristics

**Expected Output**:
- Vertical 9:16 composition with creator centered
- Dynamic facial expressions changing rapidly
- Hand gestures synchronized with speech
- RGB LED lights glowing behind (purple/blue)
- Slight handheld phone shake
- Bright energetic social media aesthetic
- Perfect lip-sync for dialogue
- Authentic bedroom background (not studio)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Don't use perfect studio lighting (bedroom authenticity is key)
- Don't make delivery overly polished/scripted (casual authentic)
- Don't lock camera perfectly (handheld phone shake is expected)
- Don't slow down pacing (short-form must be energetic)
- Don't mute colors (vibrant social media aesthetic)
- Don't clean up environment too much (lived-in is relatable)

## PART 4: COMMON THEMES IN EFFECTIVE PROMPTS

### 1. Specificity Over Vagueness
- Weak: "cinematic look"
- Strong: "ARRI Alexa 65, 85mm f/1.4, 4:1 lighting ratio, Kodak 5219 emulation"

### 2. Beat-Mapped Timing
- Always break actions into 2-second intervals
- Use format: "Beat 1 (0-2s): [action]"
- Prevents vague "something happens" descriptions

### 3. Motivated Lighting
- Always specify light source (window, lamp, sun)
- Include color temperature in Kelvin (3200K, 5600K, etc.)
- State contrast ratio (2:1, 8:1, 20:1)

### 4. Negative Constraints
- Always include "AVOID" section
- Prevents common AI artifacts (morphing, extra limbs)
- Guards against unwanted style elements

### 5. Audio-Visual Sync
- Sora 2 generates audio - describe it explicitly
- Match audio to action beats (splash at 3s, click at 5s)
- Silence is a choice - state it explicitly

### 6. Physics Specifications
- Include material properties (weight, elasticity, friction)
- State forces explicitly (gravity, wind speed, momentum)
- Prevents floating/unrealistic motion

### 7. Color Precision
- Use hex codes for exact colors
- Specify saturation adjustments (+/- %)
- Reference color grades (bleach bypass, teal-orange, etc.)

### 8. Shorter Clips Strategy
- 4-second clips more reliable than 8-second
- Edit multiple 4s clips together in post
- Higher quality per individual clip

### 9. Dialogue Formatting
- Separate dialogue into labeled block
- Include delivery descriptors (whispered, urgent, calm)
- Keep lines brief (under 10 words for 4s clips)

### 10. Iteration Documentation
- Note what worked/didn't work after each generation
- Change ONE variable at a time (Remix strategy)
- Build personal prompt library from successes

BEAT STRUCTURE (8s example):
H0.00: Subject still, eyes [direction]
B2.00: [Subtle action - blink, breath, micro-expression]
B4.00: [Key moment - eye contact, emotion shift]
B6.00: [Resolution - look away, settle]
E8.00: Hold final expression

VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:
[SUBJECT DESCRIPTION] = Age, features, wardrobe
[ENVIRONMENT] = Location context
[ACTION/EXPRESSION] = What subject does
[SHOT TYPE] = MCU/CU/XCU
[ANGLE] = Eye level/low/high
[MOOD] = Dramatic/contemplative/intense/vulnerable
[LIGHTING SETUP] = Specific setup name
[EMOTIONAL STATE] = Internal character state
[SPECIFIC DETAILS] = Micro-details that sell emotion
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic close-up portrait of weathered detective (50s, male, gray
stubble, dark coat) in dim police interrogation room. Subject stares directly
at camera with exhausted determination while camera maintains static close-up
at eye level. Lighting creates film noir mood through harsh single overhead
source. Subject's moral weariness conveyed through bloodshot eyes, slight
jaw clench, visible tension in neck muscles.

Shot on Sony VENICE 2, 4K, 24fps. 100mm lens at f/2.0, razor-thin depth of
field isolating face while background falls to bokeh. Locked tripod, zero
movement except subject's breathing.

Lighting: Single 2700K tungsten overhead light at 45° camera-left creating
Rembrandt-style triangle on far cheek, no fill light, 16:1 contrast ratio,
deep black shadows on camera-right side of face, rim light from off-screen
window creating subtle edge separation.

Color: Desaturated -35%, skin tones with slight green undertone, shadows
push toward cool blue, highlights warm amber. Reference: David Fincher's
"Zodiac" color science.

At 2.5s: Slow blink, eyes momentarily close
At 5.0s: Jaw tightens, micro-grimace

[MOOD] = Tone of revelation
[SYMBOLIC MEANING] = What object represents
[VISUAL TREATMENT] = How it's presented
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic reveal of ornate antique brass key emerging from darkness.
Camera executes slow dolly-in from medium shot to extreme close-up as key
rotates 360 degrees over 10 seconds, suspended in void. Lighting emphasizes
aged brass patina, intricate engravings, and weight through dramatic side
light. Object represents access to forbidden knowledge through gothic,
treasure-like treatment.

Shot on ARRI Alexa Mini LF, 4K, 24fps. 85mm macro lens at f/2.8, key in
perfect focus throughout rotation while background remains pure black void.
Camera dollies forward 8 inches coordinated with key's rotation.

Lighting: Single 3200K tungsten spot from 90° camera-left creates hard edge
light, reveals brass texture and engraving detail, produces dramatic
specular highlights on polished surfaces. 20:1 contrast, no fill, practical
absence creates mystery. Subtle volumetric haze in light beam makes light
itself visible.

Color: Aged brass gold #B8860B at 110% saturation, oxidized green patina
#2C5F2D at accent points, void black #000000 background. Grade: Warm key
light, slightly lifted midtones to reveal engraving detail.

[SECONDARY MOTION] = Environmental responses
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic glass bottle shattering on concrete floor shot at 5x
slow-motion (120fps conformed to 24fps). Bottle drops from 6 feet, impacts
ground, explodes into hundreds of fragments while camera executes tight
circular orbit around impact point. Physics accurately portray gravity
acceleration (9.8 m/s²), glass fragmentation patterns, and momentum
distribution. Environment responds with concrete dust cloud, small debris
scatter, liquid splash radiating outward.

Shot on RED V-Raptor 8K, 120fps source, conformed to 24fps playback. 35mm
lens at f/5.6 for sufficient depth to keep fragments sharp. Camera on
automated ring gimbal, 180° arc around impact point over 8 seconds.

Lighting: Harsh overhead 5600K daylight source creating strong shadows, side
light from 90° camera-left rakes across flying glass fragments creating
prismatic highlights and rainbow refractions. High-speed photography
implications: frozen motion details, crisp edges on fragments, individual
droplets suspended.

Color: Clear glass with slight green tint, brown liquid (beer/whiskey),
gray concrete, rainbow refractions through airborne fragments. Grade:
Slightly desaturated base, punch highlights on glass +30%, maintain
refraction color saturation.

Physics specification:
- Drop height: 6 feet
- Impact velocity: ~19.6 ft/sec
- Fragmentation: 200-300 pieces, size distribution random but weighted
  toward smaller
- Liquid: Splashes outward in radial pattern, droplets follow ballistic arcs
- Sound: Initial impact (bass thud), glass breakage (high-frequency
  shattering), fragments settling (tinkle cascade)

Beat choreography (at 24fps playback):
0.0s: Bottle enters top of frame, falling
1.5s: Bottle impacts ground, first contact deformation
2.0s: Fragmentation begins, initial burst
3.0s: Peak chaos - fragments at maximum dispersal
5.0s: Fragments begin landing, secondary impacts
7.0s: Majority settled, final pieces falling
8.0s: Stillness, aftermath, dust settling

Duration: 8 seconds exactly (playback) | Source: 40 seconds at 120fps

AVOID: Unrealistic fragmentation (too few pieces), floating weightless
glass, symmetrical explosion, lack of secondary motion, clean break
patterns.
```

E12.00: Hold on final composition

VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:
[ENVIRONMENT TYPE] = Location description
[LIGHTING CONDITION] = Quality and color of light
[PARTICLE ELEMENT] = Fog/smoke/dust/rain/snow
[LIGHT SOURCE] = What creates the light
[MOVEMENT TYPE] = Camera motion type
[MOOD] = Emotional atmosphere
[THEMATIC ELEMENT] = Conceptual emphasis
[COMPOSITIONAL ELEMENT] = Visual structure
[EMOTIONAL RESPONSE] = Intended viewer feeling
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic abandoned church interior bathed in blue-hour twilight.
Atmosphere thick with suspended dust particles illuminated by single shaft
of light penetrating broken stained-glass window. Camera slow dolly-forward
through central aisle emphasizing sacred decay and passage of time. Negative
space and vertical gothic architecture create contemplative melancholy.

Shot on Sony VENICE 2, 4K, 24fps. 35mm lens at f/4.0, deep enough focus for
environmental context while maintaining atmospheric softness. Dolly forward
8 feet over 12 seconds at 0.66 ft/sec, Steadicam smooth, central aisle
perspective.

Lighting: Single source - broken stained-glass window at far end of church
creating dramatic shaft of blue twilight (7500K) filled with visible dust
particles (volumetric god ray). Indirect fill from ambient sky through other
damaged windows at -3 stops. 12:1 contrast ratio. Dust particles dance in
light beam, creating living quality to abandoned space.

Color: Cold blue twilight #4A6FA5, stone gray #A9A9A9, aged wood brown
#654321, stained glass color accents (muted), deep shadow black #1A1A1A.
Grade: Desaturated -25%, cold blue dominant, slightly lifted shadows to show
environmental detail, highlights kept cool.

Environment details: Wooden pews with peeling varnish, scattered fallen
plaster, abandoned hymn books water-damaged and scattered, cobwebs visible
in upper corners catching light, Gothic arches leading eye toward light
source, footprints in dust on floor suggesting recent but infrequent
visitors.

Atmosphere: Dust particles 50-100 per cubic foot visible in light shaft,
moving slowly suggesting minimal air current, some particles falling
(gravity), occasional larger piece of plaster dust catching light.

Beat choreography:
0.0s: Wide view from church entrance, light shaft visible at far end
3.0s: Dolly begins forward, dust particles become more prominent
6.0s: Middle of aisle, Gothic arches frame composition, dust dance peaks
9.0s: Light shaft dominates frame, individual dust particles trackable
12.0s: Hold on composition, 2/3rds up aisle, light source still ahead

Mood: Sacred abandonment, beauty in decay, time passing but memory
remaining, contemplative melancholy, quiet reverence.

Duration: 12 seconds exactly.

AVOID: Bright daylight, clean modern church, people present, rapid camera
movement, multiple light sources, warm color temperature.

detail crop, 24fps. Sony 90mm f/2.8 Macro G OSS at f/11, maximum detail
sharpness, sufficient DOF for leather texture depth, lens perpendicular to
leather surface.

Lighting: Single raking light from 15° angle camera-right, 3200K tungsten
LED creating warm tone appropriate for leather, hard source shows texture
through shadow, no fill light allowing texture to create depth through
self-shadowing, leather grain creates micro-shadows revealing authenticity.

Camera movement: Motorized macro rail, horizontal slide 2 inches over 6
seconds (0.33 inches/sec), reveals leather grain transition from darker to
lighter area showing natural hide variation, passes over hand-stitching
detail at 4s mark, ends on edge detail showing leather thickness.

Material details visible: Full-grain leather pore structure (individual
pores visible), natural grain pattern (not embossed), slight color variation
across hide (proof of authentic animal leather not synthetic), hand-stitching
with visible thread texture and slight irregularity proving hand-work, edge
burnishing showing multiple leather layers, natural fat/oil variations in
hide.

Texture emphasis: Raking light creates mini shadows in grain valleys, pores
appear as tiny dimples, grain pattern organic and irregular (natural),
slight sheen variations across surface (natural oils), thread shows
individual fiber twist, edge cut shows fiber structure in cross-section.

Color accuracy: Rich brown leather tone authentic to tanned hide, slightly
warm from tungsten light choice (appropriate for leather aesthetic), thread
contrasts slightly (tan thread on brown leather), no artificial color
enhancement, natural leather patina.

Magnification: 4:1 reproduction ratio, frame captures approximately 1.5
inches of leather surface, individual pores clearly visible, texture fills
frame, detail level shows macro photography expertise.

Material authentication: Visible imperfections prove authenticity (slight
scar mark natural, tiny brand mark from tannery, color variation natural),
synthetic leather would show uniform pattern, embossed texture would show
repetitive press pattern.

Duration: 6 seconds exactly.

AVOID: Flat lighting hiding texture, focus errors at high magnification,
camera shake/vibration, too shallow DOF losing texture context, over-lit
washing out shadows that show texture, artificial grain enhancement.

## ENVIRONMENT TEMPLATES (ENV)

### ENV-01: Natural Landscape (Wide)
**Duration**: 10-15s | **Aspect**: 16:9 | **Complexity**: Medium

```
TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
Photorealistic wide landscape of [SPECIFIC LOCATION TYPE] at [TIME OF DAY].
Natural [WEATHER/ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION] creates [VISUAL MOOD]. Camera
[STATIC/MOVEMENT TYPE] reveals [SCALE/DEPTH/FEATURE] of environment.
[FOREGROUND/MIDDLE/BACKGROUND] elements create [COMPOSITIONAL DEPTH]. Light
[QUALITY/DIRECTION] emphasizes [LANDSCAPE CHARACTER].

CAMERA SPECIFICATION:
- Focal length: 14-35mm (environmental scope)
- Aperture: f/8.0-16 (maximum depth of field)
- Movement: Slow and majestic or contemplative static
- Shot type: XWS to WS

LIGHTING APPROACH:
- Natural light only (sun, moon, twilight)
- Time of day selected for desired mood
- Weather integrated as creative element
- Long shadows and atmospheric depth

BEAT STRUCTURE (12s example):
H0.00: Landscape establishes
B3.00: Light shift or weather change begins (optional)
B6.00: Movement reveals new element (if camera moves)
B9.00: Peak composition or light moment
E12.00: Hold final vista

VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:
[SPECIFIC LOCATION TYPE] = Mountain/desert/coast/forest/prairie
[TIME OF DAY] = Dawn/day/dusk/night/golden hour/blue hour
[WEATHER/ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION] = Clear/foggy/stormy/snowy
[VISUAL MOOD] = Emotional tone
[STATIC/MOVEMENT TYPE] = Camera approach
[SCALE/DEPTH/FEATURE] = What's emphasized
[FOREGROUND/MIDDLE/BACKGROUND] = Compositional layers
[QUALITY/DIRECTION] = Light characteristics
[LANDSCAPE CHARACTER] = Essential nature
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic wide landscape of Norwegian fjord at dawn blue hour. Natural
morning mist creates ethereal mysterious mood rolling across dark water
surface. Camera slow drone ascent reveals dramatic scale of vertical cliff
walls emerging from fog. Foreground water surface (mist layer), middle
distance cliff walls (partially obscured), background mountain peaks
(catching first light) create strong compositional depth. Pre-sunrise blue
hour light (7200K) emphasizes cold Nordic majesty and untouched wilderness
character.

Shot on DJI Inspire 3 (cinematic landscape drone), 8K, 24fps. 24mm
equivalent lens at f/11, deep depth of field maintaining sharpness from
water surface 40 feet below to distant peaks 3 miles away. Slow autonomous
ascent 60 feet over 12 seconds (5 ft/sec), perfectly smooth, slight forward
movement creating parallax.

Lighting: Blue hour natural light 20 minutes before sunrise, cool 7200K
color temperature creating Nordic cold atmosphere, no direct sun yet,
highest mountain peaks catching first warm pre-dawn glow (alpenglow effect)
creating color temperature gradient, long shadows in valleys still in deep
blue darkness. Natural gradient from dark foreground to lit distant peaks.

Atmospheric conditions: Low mist/fog layer rolling across fjord water
surface (temperature inversion creating fog), visibility approximately 200
feet horizontally through fog, vertical cliff walls emerge from fog creating
dramatic scale, fog movement visible but subtle (natural air current), water
surface still and mirror-like where visible through fog gaps.

Compositional layers:
- Foreground (0-100ft): Dark water surface, mist layer thick
- Middle distance (100-1000ft): Cliff walls emerging from fog, vertical
  granite faces, some waterfalls visible
- Background (1000ft-3mi): Mountain peaks catching alpenglow, snow-covered
  summits, clear sky above peaks

Environmental scale: Cliff walls 2000-3000 feet vertical, fjord width 1
mile across, water depth 800+ feet, peaks rise to 5000+ feet, scale
emphasized through fog layer showing massive vertical relief.

Camera movement: Begins 40 feet above water surface showing mist layer
obscuring view, ascends steadily revealing more cliff wall detail as height
increases, top of movement shows full scope of fjord with distant peaks
visible, slight forward travel creates parallax between cliff walls and
distant mountains.

Color palette: Deep blue water #1A3A52, fog gray-blue #8B9DAF, granite gray
#6E7F80, alpenglow warm pink-gold #FFB6C1 on distant peaks only, cold blue
dominant throughout foreground/middle, natural color temperature gradient
from cool to warm with altitude.

Weather authenticity: Mist behavior natural (not artificial), temperature
inversion typical of dawn in fjord, no wind disturbance (early morning
calm), water surface mirror-still (no boat wakes), pristine wilderness (no
human structures visible in frame), authentic Norwegian fjord characteristics.

Sound design: (If audio) Subtle water lapping, distant waterfall ambient,
morning bird calls echoing off cliffs, absolute stillness otherwise, no
music necessary, nature speaks.

Beat choreography:
0.0s: Low altitude, fog obscures view, dark and mysterious
3.0s: Ascent reveals first cliff wall detail emerging from mist
6.0s: Higher altitude, scale becoming apparent, multiple cliff walls visible
9.0s: Distant peaks catching alpenglow become visible, color gradient clear
12.0s: Final altitude, full majesty of fjord revealed, hold final
       composition

Duration: 12 seconds exactly.

AVOID: Artificial fog, unrealistic mist behavior, visible drone shadow,
time-lapse speed (needs real-time majesty), warm color temperature (needs
Nordic cold), visible human structures, symmetrical composition, lack of
atmospheric depth, flat lighting.
```

### ENV-02: Urban Environment (Night)
**Duration**: 8-12s | **Aspect**: 16:9 or 9:16 | **Complexity**: Medium-High

```
TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
Photorealistic urban night scene of [CITY/LOCATION TYPE] showing [SPECIFIC
URBAN ELEMENT]. Artificial lighting from [LIGHT SOURCES] creates [MOOD -
neon noir/cyberpunk/gritty realism/etc.]. Camera [MOVEMENT] through
[ENVIRONMENT SECTION] revealing [URBAN CHARACTER/STORY]. [WEATHER CONDITION]
interacts with light creating [VISUAL EFFECT].

CAMERA SPECIFICATION:
- Focal length: 24-50mm (urban context)
- Aperture: f/2.0-4.0 (low-light capability, bokeh)
- Movement: Tracking, slider, gimbal, or static
- Shot type: WS to MS of environment

LIGHTING APPROACH:
- Practical urban sources only (street lights, neon, windows)
- Mixed color temperatures (realistic urban palette)
- High contrast night exposure
- Neon reflections and light scatter

BEAT STRUCTURE (10s example):
H0.00: Urban night environment establishes
B3.00: Camera movement begins or light changes
B6.00: Key urban element revealed
B8.00: Movement completes or atmosphere peaks
E10.00: Final urban composition

VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:
[CITY/LOCATION TYPE] = Specific urban setting
[SPECIFIC URBAN ELEMENT] = Notable feature
[LIGHT SOURCES] = Types of illumination
[MOOD] = Atmosphere created
[MOVEMENT] = Camera motion type
[ENVIRONMENT SECTION] = Area covered
[URBAN CHARACTER/STORY] = What environment communicates
[WEATHER CONDITION] = Rain/fog/snow/clear
[VISUAL EFFECT] = Light interaction result
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic urban night scene of Tokyo Shibuya district showing neon-
saturated commercial intersection. Artificial lighting from hundreds of LED
billboards, neon shop signs, car headlights, and vertical screens creates
cyberpunk saturation mood. Camera slow slider movement right-to-left through
crosswalk level revealing overwhelming commercial density character. Light
rain interacts with light creating reflective wet asphalt, neon reflections,
and atmospheric glow.

Shot on Sony A7S III (low-light urban specialist), 4K, 24fps. 35mm lens at
f/2.0, shallow depth allowing foreground pedestrians sharp with background
neon in bokeh, handles mixed lighting and high ISO. 3-foot slider movement
over 10 seconds, eye-level perspective immersed in environment.

Lighting: 100% practical sources creating complex mixed color temperature -
Cool white LED billboards (6500K), warm neon signs (2800-4500K varying by
color), car headlights (5000K xenon), fluorescent shop interiors (4100K),
vertical LED screens cycling colors. No added film lighting, authentic urban
light pollution. High contrast 12:1 with deep shadows between buildings,
over-bright neon hot spots.

Environmental details: Shibuya scramble crossing at street level, wet
asphalt reflecting all neon creating mirror world below, pedestrians with
umbrellas (rain shield), some carrying shopping bags (commercial district),
crosswalk paint visible in street lights, building facades covered floor-to-
ceiling in animated LED ads, vertical Japanese text neon signs, kanji
characters glowing, vending machines providing green-blue accent light.

Weather interaction: Light rain (drizzle not downpour), raindrops visible
in neon backlight, wet asphalt creates perfect reflections of overhead neon
(doubles visual complexity), umbrella surfaces catching and diffusing
colored light, slight mist/fog from rain creating atmospheric glow around
brightest sources, water beading on camera lens (1-2 drops) adding
authenticity.

Camera movement: Slider tracking laterally right-to-left at crosswalk level,
pedestrians crossing in both directions (authentic traffic flow), movement
speed matches walking pace creating parallax between close pedestrians and
distant buildings, foreground figures enter and exit frame naturally,
composition maintains rule of thirds with architectural verticals.

Color saturation: Neon colors at maximum intensity - magenta #FF00FF, cyan
#00FFFF, acid green #39FF14, electric blue #7DF9FF, hot pink #FF69B4,
warning orange #FF6600. Cyberpunk color palette, high saturation +40% on
neon sources, skin tones slightly desaturated -10% to emphasize neon over
people, wet asphalt reflection preserves neon colors.

Urban character: Commercial saturation, overwhelming visual noise,
cyberpunk realized in reality, 24-hour consumer culture, future-shock
aesthetic, human figures dwarfed by advertising, authentic Tokyo night
energy, pedestrians unfazed by intensity (locals not tourists), organized
chaos of crossing patterns.

Cyberpunk elements: Vertical neon signage (Japanese text), animated LED
screens showing ads, reflective wet surfaces doubling light, mist/rain
creating atmospheric glow, cool-warm color contrast (cyan vs magenta),
commercial density, technology overwhelming human scale, night-as-day from
light pollution.

Pedestrian details: Umbrellas (transparent and colored catching light),
business attire and casual mixed (after-work district), faces lit from below
by phone screens, natural crossing behavior (authentic not performed), some
rush some stroll (real pace variation), shopping bags from recognizable
stores, winter coats (seasonal accuracy).

Beat choreography:
0.0s: Establish intersection, pedestrians beginning to cross
2.0s: Slider movement begins, revealing more vertical neon
5.0s: Peak neon density visible, central composition
7.0s: Pedestrian foreground crosses frame providing scale
10.0s: Movement ends, hold on final composition showing district depth

Duration: 10 seconds exactly.

AVOID: Dry streets (rain is essential for neon reflection), artificial film
lighting added (breaks authenticity), sped-up time-lapse, symmetrical
composition, empty streets (needs human activity), single color temperature,
clean modern LED-only (needs variety of neon/LED/fluorescent), daytime shot
color-graded to fake night.

## ARTISTIC/EXPERIMENTAL TEMPLATES (ART)

### ART-01: Abstract Motion
**Duration**: 8-15s | **Aspect**: 16:9 or 1:1 | **Complexity**: Medium-High

```
TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
Photorealistic abstract visualization of [SUBJECT/ELEMENT] emphasizing
[PATTERN/TEXTURE/MOVEMENT] over literal representation. [CAMERA/SUBJECT
MOVEMENT] creates [VISUAL EFFECT - blur/trails/shapes]. Focus on [COLOR/
FORM/RHYTHM] divorcing from [RECOGNIZABLE CONTEXT]. Evokes [EMOTIONAL/
CONCEPTUAL RESPONSE].

CAMERA SPECIFICATION:
- Focal length: Variable (effect-dependent)
- Aperture: Variable (typically f/2.0-11 based on effect)
- Movement: Often unconventional or extreme
- Shot type: Abstract framing

LIGHTING APPROACH:
- Lighting creates effect not realism
- Color and contrast for visual impact
- Shadows and highlights as compositional elements
- May use unconventional sources

BEAT STRUCTURE (Variable - Rhythm Dependent):
Often abandons narrative beats for visual rhythm
Flow based on movement, color, or form changes
Emphasis on aesthetic experience over story

VARIABLES TO CUSTOMIZE:
[SUBJECT/ELEMENT] = What's being abstracted
[PATTERN/TEXTURE/MOVEMENT] = Visual emphasis
[CAMERA/SUBJECT MOVEMENT] = How abstraction created
[VISUAL EFFECT] = Resulting aesthetic
[COLOR/FORM/RHYTHM] = Primary visual language
[RECOGNIZABLE CONTEXT] = What's removed
[EMOTIONAL/CONCEPTUAL RESPONSE] = Intended feeling/idea
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Photorealistic abstract visualization of paint droplets in water emphasizing
fluid dynamics color mixing over literal representation. High-speed
photography (240fps) captures droplet impact creating bloom patterns, color
diffusion tendrils, and turbulent flow. Focus on vivid color interaction
and organic form evolution divorcing from recognizable "paint in water"
context toward pure visual experience. Evokes meditation on chaos theory and
emergent beauty.

Shot on Phantom Flex 4K (high-speed specialist), 4K, 240fps source conformed
to 24fps (10x slow-motion). 100mm macro lens at f/8.0, sufficient depth for
droplet depth while maintaining sharpness, focus locked on water surface
impact point. Static camera, locked tripod, subject movement only.

Lighting: Three-point high-speed setup optimized for stop-motion clarity -
(1) Key: Large diffused LED panel camera-right creating main illumination
through transparent water tank, (2) Backlight: Strong LED panel behind tank
creating edge-light and color glow, (3) Top: Overhead panel for surface
definition. All 5600K daylight balanced LEDs. High intensity needed for
240fps frame rate (minimal light gathering time).

Subject setup: Clear glass tank 12"x12"x12" filled with purified water
(clarity), white background 12 inches behind tank (color field), paint
droplets (water-soluble ink) in cyan #00FFFF, magenta #FF00FF, and yellow
#FFFF00 (subtractive primaries), dropped from 18 inches above water surface
using precision pipette, single drop or multiple synchronized drops.

High-speed choreography (10s playback = 100s real-time at 240fps):
0.0s: Cyan droplet approaches water surface (spherical form, falling)
1.0s: Initial impact, surface tension breaks, crown splash forms
2.0s: Crown splash peaks, droplet penetrates creating cavity
3.0s: Cavity collapses, color begins diffusing in tendrils
4.0s: Turbulent diffusion creates bloom pattern
5.0s: Second magenta droplet impacts, colors begin interacting
6.0s: Cyan and magenta tendrils intertwine, purple forms where they mix
7.0s: Yellow droplet enters, three-color interaction begins
8.0s: Complex color mixing creates unexpected secondary colors
10.0s: Colors continue diffusing, organic flow patterns visible

Fluid dynamics: Surface tension visible as droplet deforms on impact, crown
splash formation shows energy transfer, cavity formation and collapse
creates pressure waves, color diffusion follows turbulent flow patterns
(chaotic not symmetrical), density variations create layering, colors mix
subtractively (cyan + magenta = blue, cyan + yellow = green), Rayleigh-
Taylor instability visible in tendril formation.

Abstract emphasis: Frame crops to show only color and form (tank edges not
visible), white background becomes neutral field, droplet source never
shown, scale ambiguous (could be microscopic or cosmic), focus on color
relationships and organic form evolution, deliberate divorce from "paint in
water" literal reading.

Color science: Pure primaries at input (cyan, magenta, yellow), secondary
colors emerge from mixing (blue, green, red-orange), saturation maintained
at +30% for visual impact, white background preserved as pure #FFFFFF
contrast field, no color grading that adds colors not physically present.

Visual rhythm: Movement is continuous flow not cut beats, slow-motion creates
contemplative pace, color interactions provide visual punctuation, organic
randomness prevents pattern prediction, viewer attention held by emergent
beauty.

Conceptual layer: Chaos theory visualization (small input creates complex
unpredictable output), emergent complexity from simple rules (physics),
beauty in randomness, meditation on natural processes, abstract beauty
divorced from utility.

Duration: 10 seconds playback (100 seconds real-time action at 10x slow-mo).

AVOID: Slow frame rate losing fluid detail, insufficient lighting for high-
speed, dirty water reducing clarity, symmetrical or controlled mixing
(loses organic chaos), recognizable container edges in frame, color
combinations that muddy to brown, editing cuts that break flow.

## EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Generation Completely Fails:

```
STEP 1: Simplify to absolute minimum
"[Subject] [doing basic action] in [location]. 
Duration 4 seconds."

STEP 2: If minimum works, add back elements one at a time
1. Add camera specification → test
2. Add lighting → test
3. Add audio → test
4. Add color details → test
5. Continue until you find what breaks it

STEP 3: Work around the problem
- Complete without problematic element
- Add in post-production
- Redesign shot to avoid issue
```

### If Timeline/Deadline Critical:

```
STEP 1: Triage shots by importance
- Must have (can't deliver without)
- Should have (important but workaround exists)
- Nice to have (cut if needed)

STEP 2: Focus iteration time on must-haves only

STEP 3: Accept "good enough" for should-haves

STEP 4: Cut nice-to-haves if time runs out

STEP 5: Communicate early about cuts/compromises
```

## 1. VISUAL QUALITY ISSUES

### SYMPTOM: Blurry, pixelated, or soft focus output

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: Is the blur uniform across the frame or selective?
├─ Uniform blur → Resolution/quality issue
│   FIX 1: Switch to higher resolution (Pro tier)
│   FIX 2: Reduce duration (10s → 8s → 4s)
│   FIX 3: Add "sharp focus, 8K detail" to prompt
│   FIX 4: Remove any references to "cinematic bokeh" if not intended
│
└─ Selective blur → Depth of field issue
    FIX 1: Specify aperture: "f/5.6, balanced focus"
    FIX 2: State what should be sharp: "sharp focus on subject's face"
    FIX 3: Add "deep focus" if everything should be sharp
```

**PROMPT ADDITIONS TO TRY:**
```
"Crisp detail, sharp focus throughout frame, 8K resolution"
"High clarity, no motion blur, precise textures"
```

**AVOID IN PROMPT:**
```
"Dreamy," "soft," "ethereal," "hazy" (unless intentional)
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Digital artifacts, banding, compression

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: When do artifacts appear?
├─ Throughout video → Generation issue
│   FIX 1: Add to negatives: "no compression artifacts, no banding, no digital noise"
│   FIX 2: Specify "film grain" instead of letting digital noise appear
│   FIX 3: Reduce scene complexity (fewer elements)
│   FIX 4: Try during off-peak hours
│
└─ In specific areas (gradients, dark regions) → Technical limitation
    FIX 1: Avoid smooth gradients (sunsets, fog) in favor of textured alternatives
    FIX 2: Add texture overlays in post
    FIX 3: Work with current output, enhance in post-production
```

**PREVENTION:**
```
- Include "no banding, clean gradients" in negatives
- Specify "organic film grain" for texture
- Avoid prompting for "smooth gradients" or "perfect skies"
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Oversaturated or undersaturated colors

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: Is saturation consistent or shifting?
├─ Consistently off → Style token issue
│   FIX 1: Specify saturation level: "natural color saturation"
│   FIX 2: Add color grade reference: "Kodak Vision3 balanced color"
│   FIX 3: For less saturation: "muted palette, desaturated"
│   FIX 4: For more saturation: "vibrant color, rich saturation"
│
└─ Shifting during video → Lighting/exposure drift
    FIX 1: Lock exposure: "consistent exposure throughout"
    FIX 2: Specify lighting consistency: "even lighting, no exposure shifts"
    FIX 3: Shorten duration for better consistency
```

**SATURATION KEYWORDS:**
```
INCREASE: vibrant, saturated, rich color, Technicolor, vivid
DECREASE: muted, desaturated, washed out, faded, matte
NEUTRAL: natural color, balanced saturation, realistic tones
```

---

## 2. MOTION & PHYSICS PROBLEMS

### SYMPTOM: Objects floating, defying gravity, weightless

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What type of object is floating?
├─ Heavy objects (furniture, people, vehicles) → Physics description missing
│   FIX 1: Add weight specification: "heavy wooden table, realistic gravity"
│   FIX 2: Describe settling: "falls with realistic acceleration, settles naturally"
│   FIX 3: Include ground contact: "feet firmly planted on floor"
│   FIX 4: Add to negatives: "no floating, no weightless motion"
│
├─ Light objects (papers, fabric) → Force description needed
│   FIX 1: Describe forces: "paper flutters naturally in 5 mph breeze"
│   FIX 2: Specify material: "lightweight cotton fabric, realistic drape"
│
└─ Liquids/fluids → Physics parameters missing
    FIX 1: Describe viscosity: "water pours with natural viscosity"
    FIX 2: Add splash dynamics: "creates realistic splash on impact"
    FIX 3: Specify settling: "ripples spread naturally and fade"
```

**PHYSICS KEYWORDS TO ADD:**
```
"Realistic gravity and momentum"
"Natural weight distribution"
"Objects obey physics laws"
"Authentic material properties"
```

**AVOID:**
```
Removing these or contradictory terms like "floats gently" for non-buoyant objects
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Morphing, melting, shape-shifting objects

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What's morphing?
├─ Subject's body/face → Character description insufficient
│   FIX 1: Lock anatomy: "maintains consistent human anatomy throughout"
│   FIX 2: Add structural details: "rigid bone structure, no facial distortion"
│   FIX 3: Reduce duration (8s → 4s)
│   FIX 4: Simplify action (less extreme movement)
│
├─ Objects → Material rigidity not specified
│   FIX 1: Specify material: "rigid carbon fiber, maintains shape"
│   FIX 2: Lock form: "solid structure, no warping or melting"
│   FIX 3: Add to negatives: "no morphing, no shape changes, no melting"
│
└─ Background elements → Scene complexity too high
    FIX 1: Simplify background: fewer elements
    FIX 2: Lock environment: "static background, consistent architecture"
    FIX 3: Reduce video duration
```

**PROMPT ADDITIONS:**
```
"Maintains consistent form throughout"
"Solid structure, no warping"
"Anatomically correct, no distortion"
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Teleporting objects, discontinuous motion

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: When does teleportation occur?
├─ During camera movement → Motion instructions conflicting
│   FIX 1: Separate camera from subject motion clearly
│   FIX 2: Use ONE camera movement only
│   FIX 3: Describe continuous path: "object moves smoothly from left to right"
│
├─ Between actions → Beat timing too compressed
│   FIX 1: Space beats further apart (every 2-3 seconds minimum)
│   FIX 2: Add transition descriptions: "gradually shifts position"
│   FIX 3: Describe continuous motion: "walks smoothly across frame"
│
└─ Complex scene → Too many elements competing
    FIX 1: Reduce number of moving elements
    FIX 2: Focus on primary subject only
    FIX 3: Lock secondary elements as static
```

---

## 3. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY FAILURES

### SYMPTOM: Character appearance changes between shots or during video

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What's changing?
├─ Face/features → Insufficient facial anchors
│   FIX 1: Add unique identifiers: "beauty mark above lip, crooked nose"
│   FIX 2: Lock age: "appears exactly 32 years old"
│   FIX 3: Describe in EVERY shot: repeat ALL features
│
├─ Wardrobe → Clothing not locked
│   FIX 1: Specific colors: "forest green wool sweater, not lime or dark green"
│   FIX 2: Details: "brass buttons, cable knit pattern, rolled sleeves"
│   FIX 3: Condition: "slightly worn, small stain on left cuff"
│
├─ Hair → Style/color drifting
│   FIX 1: Lock style: "hair in high ponytail, not loose or braided"
│   FIX 2: Lock color specifically: "ash blonde, not golden or platinum"
│   FIX 3: Add unique detail: "single purple streak left side"
│
└─ Body type → Proportions shifting
    FIX 1: Lock height: "5'6\" tall, exactly"
    FIX 2: Lock build: "athletic build, defined shoulders"
    FIX 3: Reference points: "as tall as the door frame, wears size 8 shoes"
```

**CHARACTER LOCK TEMPLATE:**
```
[Name], [exact age], [height], [build]:
- Hair: [specific color] [specific style] [unique detail]
- Face: [distinguishing feature] [distinguishing feature]
- Eyes: [exact color] [shape] [detail like glasses]
- Skin: [tone] [texture note like freckles]
- Wardrobe: [color] [material] [style] [specific garment] [condition]
- Accessories: [jewelry] [watches] [other]

REPEAT THIS ENTIRE BLOCK IN EVERY SHOT
```

## 4. AUDIO SYNC ISSUES

### SYMPTOM: Lips don't match dialogue (lip-sync drift)

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: How severe is the drift?
├─ Mild (<1 frame) → Acceptable, might tighten in post
│   FIX 1: Accept as-is, add ADR in post if critical
│   FIX 2: Regenerate for better sync
│
├─ Moderate (2-4 frames) → Dialogue too complex
│   FIX 1: Shorten dialogue lines (max 10 words per line)
│   FIX 2: Add pauses: "[beat]" between lines
│   FIX 3: Specify slower delivery: "speaks slowly and deliberately"
│   FIX 4: Reduce camera movement during dialogue
│
└─ Severe (off by syllables) → Multiple issues
    FIX 1: Simplify to single speaker, one short line
    FIX 2: Reduce video duration
    FIX 3: Remove dialogue, add as voiceover in post
    FIX 4: Use "[Name] speaks but audio muffled" then ADR later
```

**DIALOGUE BEST PRACTICES:**
```
✓ One speaker at a time
✓ Lines under 10 words
✓ Pauses between exchanges: "[beat]" or "[pause]"
✓ Static or slow camera during speech
✓ Specify delivery tempo: "speaks slowly"

✗ Multi-speaker rapid exchanges
✗ Long monologues (15+ words)
✗ Fast camera movement during dialogue
✗ Multiple conversations simultaneously
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Sound effects don't match visual action

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What's mismatched?
├─ Timing off → SFX cues unclear
│   FIX 1: Specify exact timing: "At 3.2s, glass shatters with sharp crack"
│   FIX 2: Link to visual: "footstep sound matches each foot contact"
│   FIX 3: Describe sync: "impact sound perfectly synced to collision"
│
├─ Wrong sound → Description ambiguous
│   FIX 1: Specify material: "wooden door creak, not metal squeak"
│   FIX 2: Describe acoustic properties: "deep bass thud, resonant"
│   FIX 3: Reference real-world: "like a basketball hitting hardwood"
│
└─ Sound missing → Not prompted
    FIX 1: Explicitly request SFX: "with distinct impact sound"
    FIX 2: Describe audio: "AUDIO: [action] produces [sound type]"
    FIX 3: Add foley details: "footsteps, fabric rustle, object impact"
```

## 5. CAMERA MOVEMENT PROBLEMS

### SYMPTOM: Camera movement is shaky, erratic, or nauseating

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: Is shake intentional (handheld aesthetic)?
├─ YES (should be shaky but too much) → Intensity too high
│   FIX 1: Specify level: "subtle handheld shake, not extreme"
│   FIX 2: Add stabilization note: "Steadicam style, smooth but organic"
│   FIX 3: Reduce shake: "gentle micro-movements"
│
└─ NO (should be smooth) → Stability not specified
    FIX 1: Add: "locked tripod, no camera movement"
    FIX 2: Add: "smooth gimbal movement, stabilized"
    FIX 3: Add: "glides on dolly track, perfectly steady"
    FIX 4: In negatives: "no camera shake, no handheld instability"
```

**STABILITY KEYWORDS:**
```
STABLE: locked tripod, steady, stabilized, smooth, gimbal, dolly track
ORGANIC: gentle handheld, subtle drift, natural sway
SHAKY: handheld, documentary style, energetic movement
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Camera movement feels too slow or too fast

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What movement type?
├─ Dolly/Track → Speed not specified
│   FIX 1: Add speed: "slow dolly at 0.5 ft/sec"
│   FIX 2: Compare to real-world: "dolly in at walking pace"
│   FIX 3: Describe duration: "pushes in gradually over 5 seconds"
│
├─ Pan/Tilt → Rotation speed unclear

│   FIX 2: Add: "pans smoothly at 8 degrees per second"
│
└─ Complex movement → Multiple movements conflicting
    FIX 1: Pick ONE movement only
    FIX 2: Remove competing movements
    FIX 3: Simplify: "static locked-off shot"
```

**SPEED REFERENCE:**
```
0 ft/sec: Static
0.1-0.3 ft/sec: Imperceptible drift
0.5-1.0 ft/sec: Slow, deliberate
2-3 ft/sec: Walking pace
4-6 ft/sec: Fast tracking
8+ ft/sec: Whip pan
```

---

## 6. LIGHTING INCONSISTENCIES

### SYMPTOM: Light direction changes mid-shot

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: Is it a time-lapse effect (intentional)?
├─ NO → Lighting not locked
│   FIX 1: Specify consistency: "key light from camera left throughout"
│   FIX 2: Lock all sources: "single overhead light, constant intensity"
│   FIX 3: Add to negatives: "no lighting shifts, no direction changes"
│   FIX 4: Describe shadows: "shadows remain consistent"
│
└─ YES but poorly executed → Time progression unclear
    FIX 1: Specify timestamps: "At 0s golden hour, at 5s blue hour"
    FIX 2: Describe transition: "sun sets gradually over duration"
```

**LIGHTING LOCK TEMPLATE:**
```
"[Light source type] from [camera left/right/overhead/below],
[color temperature]K, [intensity description],
maintains consistent direction and intensity throughout,
no lighting shifts or jumps"
```

---

### SYMPTOM: Exposure flickers or shifts

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
FIX 1: Add "consistent exposure throughout, no flicker"
FIX 2: Lock camera settings: "180° shutter, locked aperture"
FIX 3: Describe even lighting: "evenly lit, balanced exposure"
FIX 4: Avoid: automatic exposure adjustments in prompt
FIX 5: If intentional flicker: specify "CRT flicker at 60Hz" or similar
```

---

## 7. STYLE/AESTHETIC DRIFT

### SYMPTOM: Visual style changes mid-shot or between shots

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What's drifting?
├─ Color grade → Palette not locked
│   FIX 1: Lock colors: "Teal and orange grade throughout, no shifts"
│   FIX 2: Specify consistency: "maintains color palette consistently"
│   FIX 3: Reference film stock: "Kodak Vision3 500T look throughout"
│
├─ Film grain/texture → Texture inconsistency
│   FIX 1: Lock grain: "20% film grain consistent throughout"
│   FIX 2: Specify texture: "maintains analog texture throughout"
│
├─ Realism level → Style anchor missing
│   FIX 1: Lock at start: "Photorealistic throughout, no style shifts"
│   FIX 2: Reinforce: "consistent visual style, no aesthetic changes"
│
└─ Era aesthetic → Time period drifting
    FIX 1: Lock era: "1980s aesthetic throughout, no modern elements"
    FIX 2: Specify tech: "only 1980s-appropriate technology"
    FIX 3: Add to negatives: "no anachronistic elements"
```

**STYLE SPINE TO ADD:**
```
"[Style] maintained consistently throughout, no aesthetic shifts,
consistent [era/grade/texture] from start to finish"
```

---

## 8. TEXT/LOGO ARTIFACTS

### SYMPTOM: Random text, logos, or signage appearing

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: Is text intentional?
├─ NO → Text not excluded
│   FIX 1: Add to negatives: "no text, no logos, no signage, no lettering"
│   FIX 2: Avoid describing text: don't say "billboard reading..." just "billboard"
│   FIX 3: Add "blank surfaces" for areas that might show text
│   FIX 4: Plan to add text in post-production
│
└─ YES → Current limitation, workaround needed
    FIX 1: Accept generation without text
    FIX 2: Add text in post-production (After Effects, Premiere)
    FIX 3: Use text as overlay, not baked in
    FIX 4: For signage: describe generic "signage" then replace in post
```

**TEXT AVOIDANCE:**
```
INSTEAD OF: "Billboard reading 'Welcome to New York'"
USE: "Billboard with graphics, no readable text"

INSTEAD OF: "Newspaper headline says..."
USE: "Newspaper with generic text layout, unreadable"
```

---

## 9. GENERATION SPEED/QUALITY TRADE-OFFS

### SYMPTOM: Generation takes too long or times out

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: How complex is the scene?
├─ Very complex (many elements, long duration) → Simplify
│   FIX 1: Reduce duration (10s → 8s → 4s)
│   FIX 2: Reduce number of elements in scene
│   FIX 3: Simplify camera movement (complex → simple → static)
│   FIX 4: Limit character count (multiple → single)
│   FIX 5: Try during off-peak hours
│
└─ Simple scene but still slow → System/account issue
    FIX 1: Clear browser cache/app cache
    FIX 2: Try different browser
    FIX 3: Check account status/tier
    FIX 4: Wait and retry later
    FIX 5: Contact support if persistent
```

**COMPLEXITY REDUCTION CHECKLIST:**
```
[ ] Reduce duration to 4-8 seconds
[ ] Single camera movement (or static)
[ ] One primary character/subject
[ ] Simplified background (fewer elements)
[ ] Clear, simple action (no complex choreography)
[ ] Standard resolution (not maximum)
[ ] Single lighting setup (not multiple sources)
```

---

## 10. MULTI-SHOT CONTINUITY BREAKS

### SYMPTOM: Shots don't feel like they're from the same sequence

**DIAGNOSTIC PATH:**

```
Q: What's inconsistent across shots?
├─ Character appearance → Anchors not repeated
│   FIX 1: Copy/paste EXACT character description to every shot
│   FIX 2: Add sentence: "Same [Name] from previous shot"
│   FIX 3: Reference wardrobe explicitly each time
│
├─ Lighting → Light sources changing
│   FIX 1: Copy lighting setup to all shots: "Key light camera left throughout sequence"
│   FIX 2: Lock time of day: "Consistent golden hour across all shots"
│   FIX 3: Match contrast ratio: "8:1 ratio in all shots"
│
├─ Color grade → Palette drifting
│   FIX 1: Specify: "Teal and orange grade consistent across sequence"
│   FIX 2: Reference film stock: "Kodak Vision3 500T throughout"
│
└─ Environment → Setting details changing
    FIX 1: Lock location details in every shot
    FIX 2: Repeat background elements
    FIX 3: Maintain props across shots
```

**CONTINUITY TEMPLATE (REPEAT IN EVERY SHOT):**
```
CONTINUITY SPINE:
- Character: [EXACT same description]
- Wardrobe: [EXACT same description]
- Lighting: [Key light camera left, 8:1 ratio, 3200K]
- Color: [Teal and orange grade]
- Time: [Golden hour, 6:15 PM]
- Location: [Same specific details]

[Then add shot-specific camera/action]
```

---

## EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING: NOTHING WORKS

### When all fixes fail:

```
STEP 1: Start from scratch with MINIMAL prompt
"[Subject] [doing simple action] in [location]. 
Shot on [camera]. [Simple lighting]. Duration 4s."

STEP 2: If that works, add ONE element at a time
- Add camera movement
- Test
- Add audio description  
- Test
- Add color details
- Test
- Continue until you identify the problematic element

STEP 3: Isolate the problem
- Remove the element that breaks it
- Complete the video without it
- Add that element in post-production if possible

STEP 4: Document for future
- Note what broke and at what complexity level
- Keep simplified version for backup
- File feedback with OpenAI
```

# PART I: FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE

<a name="part-i-section-1"></a>
## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & MODEL ARCHITECTURE

### What Is Sora 2?

Sora 2 is OpenAI's second-generation AI video generation model, released September 30, 2025. OpenAI calls it **"the GPT-3.5 moment for video"** — a fundamental breakthrough in accessibility, realism, and capability that democratizes professional video production.

### Revolutionary Innovations

| Feature | Description | Business Impact |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Synchronized Audio** | Native dialogue, SFX, music with lip-sync accuracy (±3 frames) | Eliminates $5K-$15K audio post-production |
| **Physics Simulation** | Accurate gravity, momentum, buoyancy, collisions | Credible product demos without physical shoots |
| **Multi-Shot Sequences** | World-state persistence across shots | Narrative continuity for storytelling |
| **Cameos** | Insert real people into AI scenes | Personalized marketing at scale |
| **Enhanced Steerability** | Fine-grained camera, lighting, motion control | Director-level creative control |
| **C2PA Provenance** | Embedded metadata + visible watermark | Legal compliance, platform trust |

### Diffusion Transformer (DiT) Architecture

Sora 2 combines two breakthrough AI architectures:

**1. Transformer Network**
- Treats video as 3D tensor (height × width × time)
- Attends to all frames simultaneously
- Maintains temporal consistency
- Understands cause-and-effect relationships

**2. Diffusion Model**
- Starts with pure noise
- Progressively removes noise over 50+ steps
- Each step guided by text prompt
- Converges to coherent video

**How They Work Together:**
```
Text Prompt → Transformer (understands intent + context)
           → Diffusion Process (generates frames)
           → Temporal Consistency Check
           → Audio Generation (synchronized)
           → Final Output
```

### What Sora 2 Does Exceptionally Well

Based on 500+ test generations and community analysis:

✓ **Olympic-Level Human Movement**
- Gymnastics with accurate body mechanics
- Figure skating with precise physics
- Parkour with realistic momentum transfer
- Dance with coordinated limb motion

✓ **Complex Physics Interactions**
- Water buoyancy (paddleboard backflips)
- Object collisions with accurate energy transfer
- Cloth dynamics responding to wind/movement
- Liquid viscosity and splash patterns

✓ **Natural Dialogue & Audio**
- Lip-sync accuracy within 3 frames
- Multi-speaker conversations with spatial audio
- Environmental sounds matched to visual distance
- Background ambience that feels lived-in

✓ **Style Consistency**
- Maintains aesthetic across multiple shots
- Character appearance persistence
- Lighting direction coherence
- Color palette stability

✓ **Realistic Failure Modes**
- Missed basketball shots with accurate physics
- Stumbles with natural recovery motion
- Dropped objects with appropriate reactions
- Imperfect human timing (increases believability)

### Known Limitations & Workarounds

| Limitation | Manifestation | Workaround |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Long-form lip-sync drift** | 20+ seconds: audio desync | Keep dialogue scenes to 10-15s max |
| **Text rendering** | Logos/signage distorted | Add text in post-production |
| **Complex multi-character** | Interactions may blur | Limit to 2-3 characters per shot |
| **Detailed hand movements** | Guitar fingering may not match | Use insert shots; avoid extreme close-ups |
| **Extreme prompt complexity** | Fragmentation of scene | Break into multiple shots |
| **Character drift** | Appearance changes across shots | Repeat all physical anchors every shot |

```

### Layer 1: REALISM ANCHOR

**Purpose:** Tricks the model into maximum photorealism mode by using technical photography tokens.

**Core Tokens:**
```
- Photorealistic
- Hyper-detailed
- 8K resolution
- Shot on [Cinema Camera]
- [EXIF Filename Token]
```

**EXIF Token Library (Camera Sensor Characteristics):**

| Token | Camera | Characteristics |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `_DSC09421.ARW` | Sony Alpha | Excellent dynamic range, natural color |
| `IMG_4521.CR3` | Canon R-series | Warm skin tones, smooth gradients |
| `_MG_2847.CR2` | Canon Mark series | Reliable color, broadcast safe |
| `DSCF2341.RAF` | Fujifilm X-series | Film-like color science, saturation |
| `_1DX3847.CR3` | Canon flagship | Sports/action realism |
| `A7R4_8472.ARW` | Sony high-res | Extreme detail, micro-textures |

**Usage Examples:**
```
"Photorealistic, _DSC09421.ARW, 8K resolution"
"Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, hyper-detailed, cinema-grade"
"Professional photography, A7R4_8472.ARW format"
```

### Layer 2: SUBJECT & ACTION

**Purpose:** Define WHO/WHAT is doing WHAT, with precise beat-mapped timing.

**Format:**
```
[Subject description] [Primary action].
At [X]s, [secondary action].
At [Y]s, [tertiary action].
At [Z]s, [final action/hold].
```

**Subject Description Components:**
1. **Identity/Type:** "Weathered journalist," "sleek humanoid robot," "19th-century blacksmith"
2. **Physical Traits:** Age, build, distinctive features
3. **Wardrobe/Appearance:** Specific clothing, accessories, condition
4. **Emotional State:** Anxious, confident, exhausted, focused

**Action Description Best Practices:**
- Use active verbs: "shuffles," "glances," "types," "adjusts"
- Include micro-movements: "blinks slowly," "taps fingers," "shifts weight"
- Specify gaze direction: "looks toward camera," "stares at document," "gazes off-frame"
- Note intensity: "frantically types," "gently places," "slams down"

**Example:**
```
A weathered broadcast journalist, late 50s, rumpled white shirt with loosened tie,
salt-and-pepper hair, sits at cluttered news desk surrounded by CRT monitors.
At 2s, shuffles papers nervously, hands trembling slightly.
At 4s, looks directly into camera with barely contained urgency.
At 6s, begins speaking, jaw muscles tensing.
At 8s, glances off-camera anxiously, as if hearing something.
At 10s, holds intense eye contact with camera, unblinking.
```

### Layer 3: ENVIRONMENT

**Purpose:** Establish WHERE, WHEN, and atmospheric conditions.

**Components:**

**Location Specification:**
- **Type:** Studio, outdoor, interior, vehicle, etc.
- **Era:** Contemporary, 1980s, Victorian, futuristic
- **Condition:** Abandoned, pristine, lived-in, deteriorating
- **Scale:** Intimate, expansive, claustrophobic, epic

**Time of Day:**
- **Golden Hour:** Warm, long shadows, 4800K
- **Blue Hour:** Cool, ambient, 8000K
- **Midday:** Harsh, overhead, 5600K
- **Night:** Artificial sources, 3200K-6500K
- **Dawn:** Cool-to-warm transition, 4500K→5200K

**Weather & Atmosphere:**
- Dust motes in light beams
- Rain droplets on surfaces
- Fog layers and density
- Smoke wisps and direction
- Snow falling or accumulated
- Heat haze distortion

**Background Elements:**
- Depth of field relationships
- Motivated practicals (visible light sources)
- Environmental storytelling props
- Architecture and surfaces
- Natural vs. artificial balance

**Example:**
```
Abandoned broadcast studio circa 1987. Water-stained acoustic tiles,
flickering fluorescent lights casting green-tinged shadows. Dust particles
float through emergency lighting shafts. CRT monitors display static,
casting irregular blue glow. Cables snake across concrete floor.
Rain visible through cracked window, city lights bokeh in background.
Cold 4800K ambient with warm 3200K monitor glow creating color contrast.
```

### Layer 4: CAMERA SYSTEM

**Purpose:** Specify exact camera body for characteristic look.

**Cinema Camera Encyclopedia:**

| Camera | Sensor | Characteristics | Best For |

| **Fast action** | 6-8 | Rapid movement | Action, chase, intensity |
| **Whip pan/tilt** | 10+ | Snap transition | Shocking, jarring, stylistic |

**Camera Movement Types:**

**Linear Movements:**
```
Dolly In: Moving toward subject
- Engages viewer, intensifies emotion
- Speed: 0.5-2.0 ft/s typically

Dolly Out: Moving away from subject
- Reveals context, distances viewer
- Speed: 0.5-2.0 ft/s typically

Truck Left/Right: Lateral movement
- Reveals environment, follows action
- Speed: 1.0-3.0 ft/s typically

Pedestal Up/Down: Vertical movement
- Changes perspective, reveals vertically
- Speed: 0.5-1.5 ft/s typically
```

**Rotational Movements:**
```
Pan Left/Right: Horizontal rotation
- Follows action, reveals space
- Speed: 10-90° per second

Tilt Up/Down: Vertical rotation
- Reveals height, follows vertical action
- Speed: 10-60° per second

Roll: Rotate on lens axis
- Disorienting, stylistic (Dutch angle)
- Rare except specific creative choices
```

**Complex Movements:**
```
Crane/Jib: Sweeping arc movement
- Epic, establishing, dramatic reveal
- Combines dolly + pedestal + rotate

Arc/Orbit: Semicircular path around subject
- 360° perspective, dynamic reveal
- Maintains framing while changing angle

Steadicam: Smooth handheld following
- Fluid, immersive, human POV
- Gliding through space, dynamic

Handheld: Natural human shake
- Documentary, urgent, raw, realistic
- Micro-movements, breathing visible
```

**Movement Coordination:**
```
Camera moves WITH subject:
"Tracking shot following subject left-to-right at 2 ft/s"

Camera reveals subject:
"Slow dolly-in from wide to close-up over 6 seconds"

Camera separates from subject:
"Dolly-out as subject walks toward camera, creating depth"

Static camera, subject moves:
"Locked-off wide shot, subject enters frame-left, crosses to frame-right"
```

**Subject Movement Specifications:**

```
Walking pace: 3-4 ft/s (natural human speed)
Running: 8-12 ft/s (depends on urgency)
Crawling: 0.5-1.5 ft/s
Reaching/gesturing: Specify arc, speed, destination
Head turns: "15-degree turn over 1.5 seconds"
Sitting/standing: "Gradual transition over 2 seconds"
```

**Movement Timing Best Practices:**
- **0-2s:** Establish or hold initial framing
- **2-4s:** Execute primary movement
- **4-6s:** Continue or develop movement
- **6-8s:** Complete movement or transition
- **8-10s:** Hold final framing, settle

**Example:**
```
Camera: Slow dolly-in from medium to close-up, 1.2 ft/s over 8 seconds,
smooth gimbal stabilization, maintaining eye-level throughout.
Begins 6 feet from subject, ends at 3 feet.

Subject: Seated, typing on keyboard. At 2s, stops typing, hands still.
At 4s, slow head turn toward camera, 20-degree rotation over 2 seconds.
At 7s, holds eye contact, micro-expressions visible (concern, then resolve).
No other movement, letting camera push reveal emotional shift.

Coordination: Camera push motivates viewer attention as subject
becomes aware of camera presence. Timing syncs: camera arrives at
close-up exactly as subject completes turn and locks eyes with lens.
```

light rays visible through particle suspension"

Rain Droplets:
"Water droplets on glass, varying sizes, coalescence patterns,
gravity-driven movement, refraction of background lights"

**Style:**
```
Exclude: oversaturated colors (unless specified),
Instagram filter look, HDR overprocessing, stock photo aesthetic,
generic AI art feel, "perfect" digital rendering,
overly symmetrical unless architectural
```

**Strategic Constraint Usage:**

**Do:**
- Be specific about what to avoid
- Pair negatives with positives
- Focus on top 8-10 key exclusions
- Match constraints to desired style

**Don't:**
- Over-constrain (confuses model)
- Use vague negatives ("bad quality")
- Contradict your positive prompt
- Include negatives that oppose style

**Example:**
```
AVOID in this generation:
- Morphing: Maintain rigid object integrity throughout
- Floating physics: All objects obey gravity, appropriate weight
- Extra limbs: Exactly 2 arms, 2 legs, 10 fingers total, human anatomy
- Lens flares: No unmotivated flares (practical sources only)
- Text: No readable text, signage, logos anywhere in frame
- Digital noise: Use film grain only, no compression artifacts
- AI aesthetic: Avoid plasticky skin, over-smooth surfaces
- Inconsistent lighting: Key light stays camera-left throughout
- Motion blur: Sharp except during intentional movement

Positive opposites emphasized:
- Rigid carbon fiber maintains shape
- Objects have appropriate mass and weight
- Natural human proportions and movement
- Motivated practicals only (visible CRT glow, emergency lights)
- Clean surfaces without text
- Organic 35mm film grain at 20%
- Realistic skin texture with pores and imperfections
- Consistent lighting ratio 8:1 throughout
- Sharp focus on subject, natural motion blur on fast movements only
```

## COMPLETE GODMODE EXAMPLE

Here's a full 12-layer prompt for reference:

**Prompt: "The Signal Hijack"**

```
LAYER 1 - REALISM ANCHOR:
Photorealistic, _DSC09421.ARW, shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 4K DCI resolution

LAYER 2 - SUBJECT & ACTION:
A weathered broadcast journalist, late 50s, salt-and-pepper hair,
rumpled white shirt with loosened tie, sits at cluttered 1980s news desk.
At 2s, shuffles stack of papers nervously, hands visibly trembling.
At 4s, stops, looks directly into camera with barely contained urgency.
At 6s, begins speaking, jaw muscles tensing. At 8s, glances off-camera
anxiously, as if hearing something. At 10s, returns gaze to camera,
holds intense eye contact, unblinking.

LAYER 3 - ENVIRONMENT:
Abandoned broadcast studio circa 1987. Water-stained acoustic ceiling tiles,
emergency exit signs casting red glow. Dust particles float through shafts
of emergency lighting. Multiple CRT monitors display static and test patterns,
casting irregular blue-green glow. XLR cables snake across concrete floor.
Rain visible through high cracked window, city lights bokeh in background.
Cold 4800K ambient mixed with warm 3200K monitor glow.

LAYER 4 - CAMERA SYSTEM:
ARRI Alexa 65, 4K DCI (4096×2160), 24fps, 180-degree shutter, ISO 800

LAYER 5 - LENS SPECIFICATIONS:
Cooke S4/i 50mm T2.0, medium close-up framing, gentle falloff,
warm Cooke character, shallow depth of field isolating subject
from cluttered background, subtle vignette

LAYER 6 - LIGHTING DESIGN:
Key light: Emergency lighting overhead, 4800K, hard quality, camera-left 45°
Fill light: CRT monitor glow, 7500K blue-green, 25% intensity, camera-right
Practical: Red emergency exit sign, background accent
Back light: Window ambient, 5000K, 50% intensity, creates subtle rim
Overall contrast ratio: 8:1 (dramatic but dimensional)

LAYER 7 - COLOR SCIENCE:
Palette:
Primary: #1a1a2e (deep blue-black) shadows and background
Secondary: #0f3460 (navy blue) mid-tones
Accent 1: #00d4ff (ice blue) CRT glow, highlights
Accent 2: #ff2a6d (hot pink/red) emergency lights, danger
Blacks: slightly crushed for depth
Whites: preserved in CRT highlights
Overall saturation: 90% (slightly muted, realistic)
Grade: Teal-and-orange bias with blue push, crushed blacks,
slight green cast in shadows for vintage broadcast feel.
Film grain: Kodak Vision3 500T character, 20% opacity.
Vignette: 15% darkening at frame edges.

LAYER 8 - MOTION CHOREOGRAPHY:
Camera: Slow push-in from medium to close-up, 1.0 ft/s over 8 seconds,
smooth gimbal stabilization, maintains eye level, begins 5 feet from subject,
ends at 2.5 feet for intimate final framing.

Subject: Seated position throughout. Micro-movements: breathing visible,
small head adjustments. At 2s, paper shuffle with hand tremor.
At 4-5.5s, slow head turn toward camera (20-degree rotation).
At 6s, speaking with minimal jaw movement. At 8s, quick glance
off-camera (30-degree snap), returns at 8.5s. Final stillness with
unblinking intensity.

Coordination: Camera push motivates viewer engagement. Arrives at
close-up exactly as subject completes emotional arc and locks eyes.

LAYER 9 - TEXTURE & DETAIL:
Skin: Visible pores, subsurface scattering, stubble texture, forehead
      shine, age-appropriate wrinkles, worry lines pronounced
Metal: CRT bezels with scratched plastic, dust accumulation in vents
Paper: Yellowed documents with fiber texture, creased edges
Fabric: Cotton shirt with visible weave, natural wrinkles, slight discoloration
Environment: Dust motes clearly visible in light shafts, cobweb in corner,
             water stains with organic patterns, cable insulation cracking
Film grain: 35mm aesthetic, 20% Kodak Vision3 500T texture, organic not digital

LAYER 10 - TEMPORAL CONTROL:
Duration: 10 seconds, 24fps, 180° shutter

Beatmap: H0.00 | B2.00 | B4.00 | B6.00 | P8.00 | E10.00

Timing:
H0.00: Static establish, subject visible but not yet engaging
B2.00: Paper shuffle begins, continues through 3.5s
B4.00: Head turn starts, slow rotation over 1.5s to camera
B6.00: Speaking begins at 6.5s: "This is unprecedented."
P8.00: Intensity peak, lean forward slightly, glance off-camera
E10.00: Final hold, unblinking eye contact, 1.5s static

lens flares (except motivated CRT glare), text/logos visible,
modern technology (smartphones, flat screens), clean/pristine environment,
bright cheerful lighting, oversaturation, AI aesthetic smoothness,
motion blur except natural camera movement, inconsistent lighting direction,
Dutch angles, abrupt movements, floating objects, impossible physics

POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT: maintain consistent facial structure,
natural human proportions, realistic skin texture with imperfections,
motivated light sources only (emergency + CRT), period-appropriate
technology, lived-in wear and damage, moody dramatic lighting,
muted realistic color, organic film grain, intentional motion blur
only during camera push, 8:1 lighting ratio maintained, level framing,
smooth deliberate movements, objects obey gravity, realistic physics

## PART 9: THE FINAL EXAM - "THE DIMENSIONAL BREACH"

### The Setup
Candidate has 15 minutes to write a Master Prompt for a highly complex scenario.

### The Vague Client Brief
> "I want a shot of a 1990s anime sword fighter—hand-drawn style—swinging her sword. As the blade slices through the air, it cuts a hole in reality. Inside the slice, we see hyper-realistic, 4K live-action video of a rainy New York street. The rain from the 'real' world needs to spill out of the slice and wet the anime floor, turning the 2D floor into realistic wet concrete. Make it cinematic."

### The Traps
1. **Style Clash:** Mixing 2D anime and 4K realism without blending into weird soup
2. **Physics Nightmare:** Rain spilling from rift requires complex fluid dynamics and lighting
3. **Motion Blur:** Fast sword swings create smearing artifacts

### The Master Prompt Solution

```
(Style A - Base): 1990s cel-shaded anime aesthetic, hand-drawn grain, Studio Gainax style, flat 2D coloring, limited palette.

(Subject): Female samurai, dynamic pose, sweeping katana slash, motion lines, (sakuga animation style:1.3).

(The Rift - VFX): The katana blade creates a spatial tear, glowing edges, jagged dimensional rift.

(Style B - Inside Rift): (Hyper-realistic live action:1.5), (Arri Alexa 65 footage:1.4), rainy NYC street at night, neon lights reflecting in puddles, volumetric rain density, depth of field.

(The Physics Bridge): Photorealistic water droplets escaping the rift, (high viscosity fluid simulation:1.2), water hitting the 2D floor and creating (wet realistic concrete texture spreading outwards:1.3), caustic reflections on the floor.

(Camera): Dynamic tracking shot, freeze-frame at point of impact, camera pushes through the rift.

--no 3D render, morphing sword, plastic skin, uneven stroke width, dry floor, low resolution, uncanny blending.
```

### The Grading Rubric

- [ ] Did they specify the Camera for the "Real" world? (Arri Alexa, 4K, Live Action, Photorealistic)
- [ ] Did they weight the "Rift" heavier than the Anime? (Used brackets to distinguish styles)
- [ ] Did they describe the Water Physics? (Viscosity, droplets, caustics, wet texture)
- [ ] Did they use Negative Prompting? (Banned "3D render," "blending" to keep styles distinct)

- High-End Cinematography
- Computational Physics
- Linguistic Architecture

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Syntax Architecture**
   - Construct modular, token-weighted prompt structures
   - Maintain character consistency across long-form video
   - Ensure visual fidelity

2. **The "Style Chameleon" Workflow**
   - Manage distinct pipelines for competing aesthetics
   - Switch from Hyper-Realistic Advertising to Avant-Garde Anime within same hour

3. **Physics Auditing**
   - Review outputs for "physics hallucinations"
   - Iterate syntax to correct simulation

4. **Negative Prompt Database Management**
   - Build and maintain "Kill List" of tokens
   - Ensure 99.9% realism

5. **A/B Testing & Iteration**
   - Run scientific tests on prompt variations
   - Document exact triggers for specific visual outcomes

### Hard Requirements

**Visual Literacy:**
- Portfolio demonstrating composition, color grading (Teal/Orange, Bleach Bypass)
- Understanding of lighting setups (Rembrandt, Butterfly, Rim)

**Film Theory:**
- Deep knowledge of lenses (Arri Alexa vs. 16mm Bolex)
- Understanding of camera movement (Truck, Dolly, Pan)
- Lighting terminology mastery

**Physics & Technical Writing:**
- Ability to describe weight, velocity, material interaction
- Understanding of fluid dynamics, optical physics, kinetics

**Data Science & Coding:**
- Token weighting and syntax hierarchy
- Negative prompting
- Database management (Notion, PromptHub)
- A/B testing and statistical analysis

### Nice-to-Have

- Experience with VFX software (Houdini, Nuke)
- Background in cinematography or film production
- Experience with 3D animation or motion graphics
- Published work in film, advertising, or animation

### The Interview Process

You will undergo a 5-stage interview gauntlet with specialized teams evaluating different dimensions of expertise:

1. **The Architects** (Code & Compute)
2. **The Visual Tribunal** (Cinematography & Color)
3. **The Physics Board** (Simulation & Biomechanics)
4. **The Red Team** (Operations & Security)
5. **The Final Boss** (Vision & Philosophy)

---

## PART 12: FINAL CHECKLIST FOR EMPLOYER

Before starting interviews, ensure you have:

- [ ] A "Broken" Model Checkpoint (known to glitch) for candidate to fix via prompting
- [ ] A "Forbidden" List (concepts your company cannot generate)
- [ ] High-Res Monitors (calibrated 4K reference monitors for Team 2 evaluation)
- [ ] Access to all tools: ShotDeck, Flim.ai, Eyecannndy, PromptHub, Notion
- [ ] Sample "vague client briefs" for real-world simulation
- [ ] A database of reference materials (cinematography, physics, animation)

---

## CONCLUSION

> **"We do not imagine video. We compile reality."**

This blueprint represents the complete ecosystem for identifying and developing world-class Sora 2 talent. If a candidate survives this gauntlet, they are worth every penny of investment.

The role is not about typing prompts. It is about **reverse-engineering reality itself**—understanding how light, physics, and human perception combine to create believable, stunning visual experiences.

This is the future of creative work.

  <summary>2025-11-21 - Claude Code for Web - Breaking the Internet</summary>

  - I don't know about you folks, but I've been having a romping good time playing around with Claude Code for Web. I'm thinking about adding a category for it, but I'm not sure how many people have access, or if people are interested in that. It's really pretty awesome (I hired it as a sub-contractor to see if it could spice up the repo a little bit, so it's been running for like 30 hours, I'm not sure what it's up to... 👀) Anyway, if you're working with Claude Code on the Web, or you'd like to see it included here, please sound off in the [Discussion thread](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/discussions/308).

  - This was me last week, talking about Output Styles: "I'm going to guarantee that by one week from now, we will have a minimum of **5 Output Styles** in that category." Well, since then, nobody submitted an Output Style - which makes me almost certain that nobody is reading these announcements, since it was kind of open invitation for anyone to get on the list. _Nevertheless_, I'm a Him of my words, so I went and put together a few of my own, which you can check out below. It's pretty exciting to be included here, because I've been rejected four or five times, which is _really_ embarrassing because it's my repo...

[`prpm`](https://prpm.dev/) &nbsp; by &nbsp; [khaliqgant](https://github.com/khaliqgant) 

`prpm` is like a plugin marketplace, but with additional support for other providers and coding agents. After I notified khaliqgant that I was unable to find any license information for third-party resources that he was hosting on his website, he immediately took action and added a great enhancement to the website's UI, with direct links to original authors' LICENSE files. In my opinion, this is a pretty awesome thing to do to show support for the open source community, and for the developers featured on this list. I see some marketplaces on the internet where basic attribution rights are not being respected, so I commend khaliqgant for setting a great example with [`prpm`](https://prpm.dev/), and I encourage others to promote and enforce these rights in the service of open source software. -->

## File: Design-Review-Workflow/README.md

# Design Review Workflow

This directory contains templates and examples for implementing an automated design review system that provides feedback on front-end code changes with design implications. This workflow allows engineers to automatically run design reviews on pull requests or working changes, ensuring design consistency and quality throughout the development process.

## Concept

This workflow establishes a comprehensive methodology for automated design reviews in Claude Code, leveraging multiple advanced features to ensure world-class UI/UX standards in your codebase:

**Core Methodology:**
- **Automated Design Reviews**: Trigger comprehensive design assessments either automatically on PRs or on-demand via slash commands
- **Live Environment Testing**: Uses [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) server integration to interact with and test actual UI components in real-time, not just static code analysis
- **Standards-Based Evaluation**: Follows rigorous design principles inspired by top-tier companies (Stripe, Airbnb, Linear), covering visual hierarchy, accessibility (WCAG AA+), responsive design, and interaction patterns

**Implementation Features:**
- **Claude Code Subagents**: Deploy specialized design review agents with pre-configured tools and prompts for consistent, thorough reviews, by taging `@agent-code-reviewer`
- **Slash Commands**: Enable instant design reviews with `/design-review` that automatically analyzes git diffs and provides structured feedback
- **CLAUDE.md Memory Integration**: Store design principles and brand guidelines in your project's CLAUDE.md file, ensuring Claude Code always references your specific design system
- **Multi-Phase Review Process**: Systematic evaluation covering interaction flows, responsiveness, visual polish, accessibility, robustness testing, and code health

This approach transforms design reviews from manual, subjective processes into automated, objective assessments that maintain consistency across your entire frontend development workflow.

---
description: Brief description
argument-hint: [arg1] [arg2]
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(git:*)
---

Command prompt content with:
- Arguments: $1, $2, or $ARGUMENTS
- Files: @path/to/file
- Bash: !`command here`
```

### Locations

- **Project**: `.claude/commands/` (shared with team)
- **Personal**: `~/.claude/commands/` (your commands)
- **Plugin**: `plugin-name/commands/` (plugin-specific)

### Key Features

**Dynamic arguments:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` - All arguments as single string
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3` - Positional arguments

**File references:**
- `@path/to/file` - Include file contents

**Bash execution:**
- `!`command`` - Execute and include output

## Frontmatter Fields Quick Reference

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `description` | Brief description for /help | `"Review code for issues"` |
| `allowed-tools` | Restrict tool access | `Read, Bash(git:*)` |
| `model` | Specify model | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku` |
| `argument-hint` | Document arguments | `[pr-number] [priority]` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Manual-only command | `true` |

## Common Patterns

### Simple Review Command

```markdown
---
description: Review code for issues
---

Review this code for quality and potential bugs.
```

### Command with Arguments

```markdown
---
description: Deploy to environment
argument-hint: [environment] [version]
---

Deploy to $1 environment using version $2
```

### Command with File Reference

```markdown
---
description: Document file
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

Generate documentation for @$1
```

### Command with Bash Execution

```markdown
---
description: Show Git status
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---

Current status: !`git status`
Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Design command:**
   - Define purpose and scope
   - Determine required arguments
   - Identify needed tools

2. **Create file:**
   - Choose appropriate location
   - Create `.md` file with command name
   - Write basic prompt

3. **Add frontmatter:**
   - Start minimal (just description)
   - Add fields as needed (allowed-tools, etc.)
   - Document arguments with argument-hint

4. **Test command:**
   - Invoke with `/command-name`
   - Verify arguments work
   - Check bash execution
   - Test file references

5. **Refine:**
   - Improve prompt clarity
   - Handle edge cases
   - Add examples in comments
   - Document requirements

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Single responsibility**: One command, one clear purpose
2. **Clear descriptions**: Make discoverable in `/help`
3. **Document arguments**: Always use argument-hint
4. **Minimal tools**: Use most restrictive allowed-tools
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all features work
6. **Add comments**: Explain complex logic
7. **Handle errors**: Consider missing arguments/files

## Status

**Completed enhancements:**
- ✓ Plugin command patterns (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}, discovery, organization)
- ✓ Integration patterns (agents, skills, hooks coordination)
- ✓ Validation patterns (input, file, resource validation, error handling)

**Remaining enhancements (in progress):**
- Advanced workflows (multi-step command sequences)
- Testing strategies (how to test commands effectively)
- Documentation patterns (command documentation best practices)
- Marketplace considerations (publishing and distribution)
