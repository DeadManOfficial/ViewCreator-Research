- Bright, saturated colors for gaming content
- Contrasting color combinations (complementary colors)
- Consistent brand colors for recognition

### Rule 5: Pattern Interrupt
- Break from visual monotony in recommended feeds
- Use unusual angles, compositions, or elements
- Don't look like every other thumbnail

### Rule 6: Curiosity Elements
- Include visual question marks (literally or figuratively)
- Show partial reveals or "before" states
- Create visual tension or contrast

[Streamer-specific, but maintain 3-5 core brand colors]
