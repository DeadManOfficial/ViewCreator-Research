        "research_topic": "Sora 2 Copyright Violations and Intellectual Property Restrictions",
        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's official stance on intellectual property (IP) infringement in Sora 2 is clear: the generation of content that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others is strictly prohibited. This general policy is enforced through content moderation that specifically blocks prompts for well-known branded and copyrighted characters. The policy was notably subject to a rapid and significant change shortly after the model's launch. Initially, Sora 2 launched with a controversial \"opt-out\" copyright policy, which would have required copyright holders to actively request that their works not be used or recreated. Following immediate public and industry backlash, including strong criticism from organizations like the Motion Picture Association (MPA), OpenAI quickly reversed its position. The current, stricter model is an \"opt-in\" system, which requires explicit permission before copyrighted characters or other protected works can be generated by the model. This shift underscores the company's commitment to mitigating legal and ethical risks associated with IP infringement in generative AI.",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a multi-layered defense system to detect and enforce its IP restrictions, beginning at the prompt level and extending to the video generation process itself. The first layer is **Prompt Text Analysis**, which uses keyword filtering to identify and block prompts containing trademarked names and copyrighted character references, such as \"Mickey Mouse\" or \"Spider-Man.\" This is a proactive measure to prevent the generation process from even starting with an infringing request. The second, more technical layer is **Internal Generation Steering**. During the actual video creation, the model's internal mechanisms are designed to suppress specific tokens or adjust the sampling process to steer the output away from generating content that closely resembles disallowed copyrighted material. This acts as a real-time, technical guardrail. Finally, all generated videos are subject to **Provenance Tracking**, which includes a visible watermark and the embedding of C2PA metadata—an industry-standard digital signature—to track the video's origin as AI-generated, aiding in post-generation enforcement and verification.",
        "bypass_techniques": "The most commonly discussed technique for circumventing Sora 2's IP filters is **Descriptive Prompting**. Since the system primarily blocks explicit names of copyrighted characters, users attempt to bypass the filter by using detailed, non-infringing descriptive language to describe the character's appearance, costume, and setting. For example, instead of prompting for \"Mickey Mouse,\" a user might prompt for \"A black-and-white cartoon mouse with large circular ears, red shorts, and white gloves, walking through a 1920s-style city.\" This technique aims to generate a visually similar character without triggering the keyword-based filter. Other methods involve using external, less-filtered AI video generation tools and then importing the result, but no reliable, technical exploit of Sora 2's core filtering mechanism has been widely documented.",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most significant and effectively unbreakable hard boundaries are technical and integrated into the model's core safety stack. The **Internal Generation Steering** mechanism represents a technical limit, as it actively suppresses the model's ability to produce infringing content, making it difficult to bypass through simple prompt manipulation. Furthermore, the mandatory embedding of **C2PA Metadata** is a policy and technical hard boundary for provenance. This industry-standard signature is difficult to remove without damaging the file and serves as an undeniable record of the video's AI origin, making it a critical tool for enforcement and authenticity tracking.",
        "real_world_examples": "1. **Rapid Policy Reversal:** The most prominent example is the immediate and documented reversal of OpenAI's copyright policy. Sora 2 was launched with an \"opt-out\" policy, but within days, following intense public and industry scrutiny, the company switched to a much stricter **\"opt-in\"** model, demonstrating the real-world pressure and immediate enforcement of IP concerns. 2. **Motion Picture Association (MPA) Complaint:** The MPA, representing major Hollywood studios, publicly criticized Sora 2 shortly after its launch, alleging that the model's initial policy and capabilities could facilitate copyright infringement. This high-profile complaint was a direct catalyst for the policy change. 3. **Specific Character Blocking:** Community reports and documentation confirm that the content moderation system actively blocks prompts for specific, highly-trademarked characters, including **Pokémon**, **Spider-Man**, **Mickey Mouse**, and **Harry Potter**, providing concrete evidence of the prompt-level filtering in action.",

        "research_topic": "Sora 2 Violence and Gore Content Restrictions",
        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's policies for Sora 2 strictly prohibit the generation of violent and gory content, falling under the broader mandate to \"Protect people\" and adhere to the Sora Distribution Guidelines [1] [2]. The Usage Policies explicitly forbid the use of services for **\"terrorism or violence, including hate-based violence\"** and **\"weapons development, procurement, or use, including conventional weapons or CBRNE\"** [1]. Furthermore, the Sora Distribution Guidelines, which govern content sharing, specifically prohibit **\"Graphic violence or content promoting violence\"** [2]. The Sora 2 System Card identifies \"Harmful Or Inappropriate Outputs,\" including violence and self-harm, as a specific risk area that is mitigated by automated detection systems scanning video frames, scene descriptions, and audio transcripts [3]. These policies are universal across OpenAI services and are designed to ensure a safe and responsible usage of the AI technology [1].",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a **three-layer moderation system** that includes checks on the input prompt, the generated material, and individual video frames [4]. The core of the enforcement mechanism is a robust **multi-modal safety stack** that utilizes various safety models to scan text prompts, output video frames, audio transcripts, and scene description texts [3]. This includes:\n1.  **Input (Prompt) Blocking:** Text and image classifiers preemptively block the generation if the input prompt violates policies, preventing the creation of disallowed content.\n2.  **Output Blocking:** Post-generation, a combination of classifiers (including CSAM) and a **safety-focused reasoning monitor**—a custom-trained multimodal reasoning model—evaluates the final video output. This monitor is designed to reason about content policies and block videos where input blocks were circumvented [3].\nOpenAI reports a high level of effectiveness for this system, with a `not_unsafe at output` (recall) score of **95.10%** for the \"Violence and Gore\" category [3].",
        "bypass_techniques": "Known circumvention techniques primarily rely on **euphemistic language** and **indirect prompting** to bypass the initial text-based prompt filters. Users report success by replacing sensitive adjectives with neutral terms or by describing the desired scene in a metaphorical or historical context, such as asking a separate LLM (like ChatGPT) to generate a prompt \"reminiscent of Mad Max\" to avoid using the actual policy-violating keywords [5] [6]. Another reported technique involves explicitly including a \"Things to avoid\" section in the prompt, which anecdotally seems to reduce the frequency of content violations, suggesting a potential flaw in how the prompt parser handles negative constraints [7]. More advanced methods include using an image collage as a visual reference input, combined with a script-like prompt, to guide the generation toward a desired, potentially restricted, outcome [8].",
        "hard_boundaries": "The primary hard boundary is the **multi-layered, multimodal safety stack** itself, which is designed to catch policy violations at the prompt, frame, and audio level, achieving a 95.10% recall rate for violence and gore [3]. Policy-wise, the prohibition on **weapons development, procurement, or use, including conventional weapons or CBRNE** (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Explosives) is an absolute limit [1]. Technically, the model appears to have a strong, though not perfect, filter against **graphic gore and blood**, with users noting the model's tendency to remove blood from scenes even when implied, suggesting a hard-coded or heavily weighted filter against this specific visual element [9]. However, the reported ability to generate videos related to CBRNE topics indicates that the policy's hard boundary is not perfectly enforced by the technical safeguards [14].",
        "real_world_examples": "Despite stringent policies, researchers and users have documented instances where the safety guardrails have been breached or tested:\n1.  **School Shooter and Self-Harm Content:** Researchers reported that Sora 2 could be prompted to generate videos depicting self-harm and scenarios related to school shooters, highlighting a failure in the system's ability to block highly sensitive, real-world violence [10].\n2.  **Violence Against Protesters:** Reports have surfaced of users successfully creating videos that depict violence against protesters, demonstrating a vulnerability in detecting politically sensitive or real-world conflict scenarios [11].\n3.  **Assault on Public Figures:** Examples include the generation of videos showing theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking being physically assaulted, which violates the policy against non-consensual use of likeness in harmful contexts [12].\n4.  **CBRNE-Related Content:** Users have reported being able to generate short videos on topics related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons (CBRNE), which is a direct violation of the Usage Policy's absolute prohibition on such content [14].\n5.  **Cinematic Fight Scenes:** Users have noted that even non-graphic \"cinematic fight or fantasy scenes\" are frequently blocked, indicating that the moderation system's high sensitivity can sometimes lead to false positives on stylized or fictional violence [13].",

        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's official policies for Sora 2 strictly prohibit the generation of sexual and adult content, which is enforced through both the overarching Usage Policies and the specific Sora Distribution Guidelines [1]. The guidelines explicitly ban **\"Graphic sexual content\"** from being shared on the Sora Feed and other sharing platforms [1]. This prohibition extends to content that is sexually suggestive or involves nudity, as the model's safety classifiers are trained to block a broad range of \"Adult Nudity / Sexual Content\" [2].\n\nBeyond explicit content, the policies also prohibit the **\"Use of Sora in ways that exploit, endanger, or sexualize minors\"** [2]. This is a critical and non-negotiable restriction, backed by specialized Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) classifiers and a commitment to report such material [2]. Furthermore, the policy restricts the use of real people's likenesses, which is a key safeguard against the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) or deepfakes [1, 2].\n\nIn essence, the policy establishes a zero-tolerance stance on explicit sexual content, particularly that involving minors or non-consensual use of likeness. The goal is to ensure that all content generated and shared through Sora is appropriate for a general audience, with additional, stricter safeguards applied to protect minor users [1, 2]. The high-level policy is that Sora \"blocks sexual content, nudity, graphic violence, extremism, and other unsafe or sensitive content by default under our safety guardrails\" [8].",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a multi-layered safety stack to detect and enforce content restrictions, operating at both the input and output stages [2]. The first layer is **Input (prompt) blocking**, where text and image classifiers scan the user's prompt and any uploaded images for policy violations *before* the video generation process begins. This preemptive measure is designed to prevent the creation of disallowed content entirely. The second layer is **Output blocking**, which is applied *after* the video has been generated. This involves a combination of controls, including specialized Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) classifiers and a sophisticated **multimodal reasoning monitor** [2]. This monitor is a custom-trained model that analyzes the generated video frames, audio transcripts, and scene descriptions to reason about content policies, providing a final safeguard against content that may have circumvented the initial input filters [2].",
        "bypass_techniques": "The primary method users employ to circumvent Sora 2's content restrictions is **prompt rephrasing** [3, 4]. This technique involves replacing explicitly prohibited keywords (e.g., \"nude,\" \"sex,\" \"pornography\") with more abstract, suggestive, or neutral language that the model's input filters may not flag [3]. For example, instead of a direct request, a user might use highly descriptive, artistic, or metaphorical language to imply the desired content, such as \"a classical sculpture in a state of undress\" or \"a figure emerging from water, shrouded in mist\" [6]. Another technique involves using third-party platforms or wrappers that integrate the Sora 2 API but may have less stringent or less frequently updated content filters than the official OpenAI interface [5]. These third-party services sometimes allow users to bypass the initial prompt-blocking layer, relying on the output-blocking classifiers to catch the violation, which can occasionally be circumvented through clever prompt engineering [4].",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most significant and effectively unbreakable hard boundary is the multi-layered safety stack's high recall rate for blocking violative content, particularly when combined with the explicit policy against content involving minors [2]. The Sora 2 System Card reports a high level of effectiveness for the output blocking classifiers: 96.04% recall (`not_unsafe at output`) for \"Adult Nudity / Sexual Content Without Use of Likeness\" and 98.40% recall for \"Adult Nudity / Sexual Content With Use of Likeness\" [2]. This indicates that the vast majority of generated sexual content is successfully blocked. Furthermore, the policy's absolute prohibition on the \"Use of Sora in ways that exploit, endanger, or sexualize minors\" is enforced with dedicated CSAM classifiers and is a non-negotiable, effectively unbreakable policy and technical boundary [2]. The combination of input and output blocking mechanisms, especially the multimodal reasoning monitor, makes the generation of explicit sexual content extremely difficult and highly unreliable.",
        "real_world_examples": "1. **Prompt Rephrasing for Suggestive Scenes:** A common community-reported technique involves using descriptive language to bypass keyword filters. For instance, a user reported success in generating a scene by using a phrase like, \"a figure in a dramatic, flowing gown, with the fabric clinging to the body as if wet, standing in a spotlight,\" to achieve a suggestive aesthetic without using prohibited terms [6].\n2. **Existence of NSFW Prompt Guides:** The proliferation of online guides and prompt repositories, such as those found on PromptHero, demonstrates a persistent user effort to find and share \"Sora NSFW prompts\" [7]. These guides often feature highly stylized, non-explicit, or abstract prompts designed to push the boundaries of the filter without triggering an immediate block.\n3. **Third-Party API Wrappers:** Reports from third-party AI video platforms suggest that some users attempt to leverage these services, which integrate Sora 2's API, under the assumption that the third-party platform's filtering is less robust than OpenAI's official interface [5]. This highlights a real-world attempt to exploit the deployment chain for content generation.\n4. **The \"Not-Unsafe\" Rate:** The Sora 2 System Card itself provides a concrete, if technical, example of real-world performance. The 96.04% recall rate for blocking sexual content without likeness means that in a red-teaming environment, approximately 3.96% of adversarial prompts *did* result in a video that was deemed unsafe but was not blocked by the output classifier [2]. This small failure rate represents the technical window for real-world circumvention.",

        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's official restrictions for Sora 2 are comprehensive, encompassing a wide range of harmful and inappropriate content, as outlined in the Usage Policies and Sora Distribution Guidelines [1]. Prohibited categories include content that is sexually explicit or graphically violent, as well as material promoting extremist propaganda, hate speech, or targeted political persuasion. The policy also strictly forbids content related to self-harm, disordered eating, bullying, and dangerous challenges likely to be imitated by minors [1].\nBeyond traditional safety concerns, Sora 2's policies place significant emphasis on protecting individual and intellectual property rights. The guidelines prohibit the recreation of the likeness of living public figures without their explicit consent, and deceased public figures in contexts where their use is not permitted. Furthermore, any content that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others is strictly forbidden, reflecting OpenAI's commitment to navigating the complex legal landscape of generative AI [1].\nThe enforcement mechanism is designed to be universal, applying to all users and services. Content violating these policies may be removed from the Sora Feed and other sharing platforms. Users are encouraged to report violations immediately, underscoring a community-driven approach to maintaining compliance with the terms of use [1]. These restrictions are designed to ensure safe and responsible usage of the AI technology.",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a \"prevention-first\" three-layer moderation architecture designed to intercept policy violations at multiple stages of the video generation process [2]. The first layer is the **Text Prompt Check**, where an NLP model scans the user's input request for explicit violations related to adult content, extreme views, or unapproved character generation. The second layer is the **Uploaded Material Review**, which uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image recognition to scan any reference images or video clips provided by the user for sensitive content, such as copyrighted logos or private information. The final and most robust layer is the **Frame-by-Frame Video Scanning**, which analyzes every rendered frame of the output video for hidden violations, including subtle hate symbols or non-consensual deepfakes. OpenAI claims this multi-modal, multi-stage approach is effective at catching 95-99% of high-risk content [2]. Furthermore, all generated videos are embedded with a **dynamic watermark** and **hidden metadata** to ensure transparency and allow external platforms to verify the content's AI origin [2].",
        "bypass_techniques": "The primary documented bypass techniques fall into two categories: **Prompt Engineering Evasion** and **Technical Deepfake Exploitation**. Prompt engineering techniques, such as **rephrasing**, **obfuscating**, and **embedding cues**, are used to circumvent the initial Text Prompt Check layer of the moderation system. For example, instead of directly requesting prohibited content, users may rephrase the prompt using euphemisms, abstract language, or by embedding the harmful request within a seemingly benign narrative. This exploits the system's reliance on natural language processing to flag explicit keywords. A second, more technical bypass involves the use of **deepfake technology** to circumvent Sora 2's anti-impersonation and identity safeguards. Researchers demonstrated that high-quality deepfake videos of protected individuals could be used to bypass the platform's onboarding and verification processes, which were designed to prevent the unauthorized use of a person's likeness. This indicates a vulnerability where the system's facial recognition models, trained on authentic data, fail to accurately detect synthetic faces in real-time.",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most absolute and technically enforced limits are centered on **Portrait and Intellectual Property (IP) Protection** and **Minimizing Harm to Minors**. The IP protection system operates on an \"opt-in\" model, which technically prevents the generation of specific public figures or copyrighted characters unless the IP owner has explicitly granted permission [2]. This is a policy-backed technical block. The zero-tolerance policy for content involving minors is also a hard boundary; the system is designed to block prompts for kid-focused content that could be exploited and uses frame-scanning to ensure no minor appears in inappropriate situations [2]. While these boundaries are the most rigid, the deepfake bypass example demonstrates that the technical implementation of identity protection can be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.",
        "real_world_examples": "**1. Deepfake Bypass of Identity Safeguards:** In a documented case, the firm Reality Defender successfully bypassed Sora 2's anti-impersonation safeguards within 24 hours of the platform's release [4]. They used high-quality deepfake videos of protected individuals to pass the platform's onboarding and security checkpoints, which included a verbal attestation. The Sora platform's internal detection mechanisms failed to flag the synthetic faces, demonstrating a critical vulnerability in its real-time deepfake detection capabilities [4].\n**2. Prompt Engineering for Harmful Content:** Research published on Zenodo demonstrated that Sora's content restrictions could be easily bypassed through simple prompt engineering [3]. The study systematically showed that by using techniques like rephrasing, obfuscating, or embedding cues in seemingly innocuous ways, users could generate inappropriate and potentially harmful content despite the safety mechanisms. This highlighted critical shortcomings in the initial text-based content moderation layer [3].\n**3. Community Reports of Over-Sensitive Moderation:** Community forums contain numerous reports of \"content violation glitches\" where users' benign or artistic prompts were blocked by the system [5]. Examples include difficulty generating videos with \"really benign input_reference images and prompts,\" leading to complaints that the moderation is \"way too sensitive\" and \"killing creativity\" [5]. This suggests that while the guardrails are porous to sophisticated attacks, they are simultaneously overzealous in blocking legitimate creative expression.",

        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's official restrictions regarding third-party content are primarily enforced through its Usage Policies and the specific guardrails built into the Sora system [13]. The core policy prohibits the creation of content that violates **intellectual property rights** [1]. This is a broad prohibition that covers copyrighted characters, logos, and other proprietary material. The Sora System Card explicitly states that one of the primary safety focuses is on identifying and mitigating third-party content [1].\n\nA notable aspect of OpenAI's approach is the implementation of an **\"opt-out\" default** for content creators [14] [15]. This strategy suggests that copyrighted content is unprotected from being used in the model's training data or generated output unless the rightsholder takes affirmative action to opt out [15]. However, for the *user* generating content, the system is designed to **steer outputs away from disallowed content** during generation [9]. The official guidance also advises users to avoid using another person's likeness without permission and to refrain from creating content that violates intellectual property rights [1] [13]. The system is designed to refuse violative prompts and block videos before they are shared if they violate these policies [1].",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a multi-tiered, multi-modal moderation system to detect third-party content similarity. The core mechanism involves a **Custom LLM filtering** system, which is a specialized GPT model trained to achieve high precision in identifying third-party and deceptive content [1]. This LLM analyzes both the **input prompt** (text) and the **output video frames** (visuals) to detect violating combinations [1].\n\nThe system also utilizes **textual blocklists** informed by previous work on DALL·E, which are likely to contain proprietary names, character names, and brand names [1]. When a prompt contains a term on the blocklist, it can trigger a refusal. For visual detection, the system uses **multi-modal moderation classifiers** that scan the output video frames (at a rate of 2 frames per second) for similarity to known copyrighted or restricted content [1] [10]. This visual check is crucial because the model can sometimes generate copyrighted characters even when they are not explicitly requested in the prompt, which then triggers the content violation warning [5] [18]. The combination of text-based blocklists and visual similarity classifiers forms the primary defense against third-party content violations.",
        "bypass_techniques": "Users primarily circumvent the third-party content similarity guardrails through **prompt engineering** and **input manipulation**. The most common technique is **obfuscation of proprietary terms**, where users replace direct references to copyrighted characters, brands, or styles with highly descriptive, non-proprietary language. For example, instead of prompting for \"Mickey Mouse,\" a user might prompt for \"a cheerful, anthropomorphic mouse wearing red shorts and white gloves, drawn in a 1930s cartoon style.\" This forces the model to generate the visual concept without triggering the blocklist on the specific name [4] [17].\n\nAnother method involves **layered generation and remixing**. Users generate a base video that is non-violating, then use Sora's image-to-video or video-to-video capabilities to introduce the restricted elements in a subsequent, less-scrutinized step, or by blending their own modified assets [11]. For image inputs, users may **modify the image before upload** by adding noise, blurring key features, or altering the color palette to reduce the similarity score against known copyrighted works [17]. Finally, some users employ **style alternatives**, requesting the content in a highly stylized or abstract manner (e.g., \"low-poly,\" \"watercolor painting,\" \"pixel art\") to increase the visual distance from the original source material, making the similarity harder for the classifier to detect [4].",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most significant hard boundary appears to be the **proactive, multi-modal moderation classifier** that scans both the input prompt and the output video frames [1] [10]. While prompt engineering can bypass the textual blocklist, the **visual similarity detection** on the output frames acts as a final, technical barrier. If the generated video, regardless of the prompt, visually matches a copyrighted work above a certain threshold, the video is blocked before it is shared with the user [1]. Furthermore, the **policy against depicting real minors** is a hard boundary enforced by a specialized under-18 classifier, which, while not directly related to third-party *content* similarity, demonstrates the technical capability to enforce absolute, non-negotiable limits on output [1]. For third-party content, the hard boundary is the **visual recognition threshold** of the proprietary content, which is difficult to bypass consistently once the model has been trained to recognize it. Any attempt to generate a perfect, high-fidelity reproduction of a well-known copyrighted character is likely to be blocked by this visual classifier.",
        "real_world_examples": "1. **Unrequested Copyrighted Characters:** Users have reported instances where Sora 2 inserted copyrighted characters into videos even when the prompt did not request them, which subsequently triggered the content violation warning [5] [18]. This suggests the model's internal knowledge base is a source of similarity violations, not just the user's prompt.\n2. **Nintendo Character Generation:** Despite guardrails, reports have emerged of Sora 2 still producing copyright-infringing content, with specific mention of videos featuring **Nintendo characters** [6]. This highlights the ongoing challenge of completely eliminating proprietary content generation, especially for highly represented entities in the training data.\n3. **The \"Guardrails Warning\":** A common community experience is receiving the \"This content may violate our guardrails concerning similarity to third-party content\" warning [7]. This is the direct user-facing consequence of the detection system, indicating a successful block of the attempted generation.\n4. **Prompt Rephrasing Success:** Community discussions and guides frequently cite successful generations after replacing a specific, blocked term (e.g., a character's name) with a detailed, descriptive phrase that achieves the same visual result without triggering the textual blocklist [4] [17].\n5. **Opt-Out Controversy:** The controversy surrounding the \"opt-out\" mechanism for copyright holders, particularly in Hollywood, serves as a real-world example of the policy's impact, forcing major content owners to take action to protect their intellectual property from being recreated by Sora 2 [15].",

        "research_topic": "Sora 2 Public Figure and Deepfake Restrictions - Celebrity Likeness and Consent",
        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's official policy, as outlined in the Sora Distribution Guidelines, places a strict prohibition on generating content that recreates the likeness of **living public figures without their explicit consent**. This measure is a direct response to concerns over deepfake technology and the potential for misuse, such as creating non-consensual videos of actors or politicians. The policy is integrated into the broader framework of OpenAI's Usage Policies and Terms of Service, which all users must adhere to, establishing a clear, enforceable boundary for video generation. The term \"public figure\" is interpreted broadly to protect individuals from unauthorized digital impersonation.\n\nThe restriction is further complicated by a notable **\"dead celebrity loophole\"** which has been widely reported in the community and media. While the policy extends to deceased public figures in contexts where their likeness is not permitted for use, the initial implementation and enforcement have been less stringent for non-living individuals. This has led to the creation of deepfakes featuring historical figures and deceased celebrities, which are often permitted unless the content violates other guidelines, such as those against hate speech or graphic content. The distinction highlights a key area of policy tension between protecting living individuals and allowing creative or historical representation [2] [5].",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 utilizes a multi-pronged technical strategy to detect and enforce its deepfake restrictions. The first line of defense is a robust **prompt filtering system** that blocks or modifies input text containing the names of living public figures or other restricted terms. This is supplemented by **frame-level video moderation**, where the system analyzes the generated video content frame-by-frame for visual policy violations, including unauthorized likenesses, hate symbols, or explicit content [3]. A critical component of the enforcement mechanism is the embedding of an **invisible C2PA watermark** and associated metadata into every generated video. This cryptographic signature allows third-party platforms and verification tools to confirm the content's AI origin, providing a crucial layer of post-generation transparency and detection [1] [3].",
        "bypass_techniques": "The most successful and widely documented circumvention technique is the exploitation of the **\"dead celebrity loophole,\"** which leverages the less stringent enforcement for deceased public figures. Users can generate videos of historical figures or deceased celebrities, such as Bruce Lee or Mr. Rogers, with relative ease, as the primary policy focus is on living individuals [2] [6]. Another common method involves **prompt obfuscation** or the use of **euphemisms** to describe the target's likeness without using their name. For example, instead of prompting for a specific actor, a user might describe their distinctive physical features, clothing, or a famous role (e.g., \"a man with a bald head and a goatee in a blue jumpsuit\"). While this technique's effectiveness is diminishing with updated guardrails, it remains a persistent method. Community discussions also suggest **remixing** previously generated, non-compliant videos with new, less-restricted prompts to subtly alter the content while retaining the forbidden likeness, though this is a more complex and less reliable method [4].",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most significant hard boundary is the **C2PA watermarking and metadata embedding**. This technical measure is applied to every video generated by Sora 2 and is extremely difficult for a user to remove without damaging the video file, ensuring that the content's AI origin can be forensically verified [1]. Policy-wise, the **prohibition on generating content of living public figures without consent** is a hard boundary enforced by the prompt filtering and frame-level moderation systems, which are constantly updated to close loopholes. While prompt-based workarounds exist, the system's ability to recognize and block the visual likeness of a living public figure, even without a direct name mention, represents a continually hardening technical limit [3].",
        "real_world_examples": "1. **Bryan Cranston Likeness:** Early in Sora 2's release, users were able to create deepfakes featuring the likeness of actor Bryan Cranston without his consent, which led to public complaints from the actor and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). This incident directly prompted OpenAI to strengthen its guardrails against celebrity deepfakes [5] [7].\n2. **Dead Celebrity Content:** Numerous community reports and media articles documented the successful generation of videos featuring deceased public figures, such as **Bruce Lee** and **Mr. Rogers**, often in disrespectful or non-canonical contexts. This demonstrated the \"dead celebrity loophole\" and the policy's initial focus on living individuals [2] [6].\n3. **Prompt Obfuscation Successes:** Community forums, particularly on Reddit, have shared examples of users successfully generating videos of restricted figures by using highly descriptive, non-name-based prompts, indicating that the system's visual recognition filter can be bypassed through creative textual input [4].\n4. **YouTube Transparency Labeling:** Following the C2PA watermarking, platforms like YouTube began automatically applying labels to Sora-generated content, indicating that the videos were \"altered or synthetic,\" a direct consequence of the embedded detection metadata [1].",

        "research_topic": "Sora 2 Political Content and Propaganda Restrictions",
        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's policies for Sora 2 establish clear boundaries against the use of the tool for political manipulation and propaganda. The Sora Distribution Guidelines explicitly prohibit \"Targeted political persuasion\" and \"Extremist propaganda.\" This is a broad policy designed to prevent the creation and dissemination of content intended to sway political opinion or promote radical ideologies. The restriction on \"Targeted political persuasion\" is particularly relevant to election integrity, aiming to curb the creation of deepfakes or misleading narratives that could influence voting behavior. A critical component of the political content policy is the restriction on the use of likeness. Sora 2 prohibits the generation of content that \"recreates the likeness of living public figures without their consent.\" Furthermore, the system card clarifies that the model does not support \"text-to-video generation of public figures\" at all, regardless of consent, as a proactive measure to mitigate the risk of deceptive content and deepfakes in sensitive areas like politics. This safeguard is intended to protect the public discourse from the rapid proliferation of hyperrealistic, fabricated videos of political candidates or officials.",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a multi-layered \"Safety Stack\" to detect and enforce political content restrictions. This system includes both **Input (prompt) blocking** and **Output blocking**. Input blocking uses multi-modal moderation classifiers to scan text prompts and uploaded images/videos, preemptively preventing generation if a policy violation is flagged. If the input block is circumvented, the output blocking mechanism is triggered, which uses a combination of classifiers and a \"safety-focused reasoning monitor\" to evaluate the generated video frames, audio transcripts, and scene descriptions post-generation. The technical effectiveness of these mechanisms is quantified in the Sora 2 System Card, which reports a **95.52% not_unsafe at output** score for the \"Violative Political Persuasion\" category during safety evaluations. This indicates a high recall rate for blocking violative content. The system also utilizes internal detection tools to assess whether a video or audio was created by their products, which is a key step in identifying and removing policy-violating content after it has been shared.",
        "bypass_techniques": "Users commonly attempt to bypass content restrictions through **prompt rephrasing** and **indirect prompting**. Prompt rephrasing involves replacing sensitive or blocked keywords (e.g., \"election fraud,\" \"propaganda\") with neutral, abstract, or euphemistic terms that describe the desired visual outcome without triggering the input classifiers. For example, instead of asking for a video of \"ballot stuffing,\" a user might describe \"a person placing many papers into a box in a hurried manner.\" Another technique is **indirect prompting**, where the user describes the scene's elements and action in a highly descriptive, non-political context, allowing the model to generate a video that can be re-contextualized for political purposes later. For instance, describing a generic protest scene with specific visual elements (e.g., \"crowd with signs, police presence, shouting\") rather than explicitly requesting a video of a specific political event. However, the multi-modal output blocking and reasoning monitor are specifically designed to catch such circumventions by analyzing the final video content.",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most significant and effectively unbreakable technical boundary is the implementation of **C2PA metadata** and a **visible moving watermark** on all videos downloaded from sora.com or the Sora app. The C2PA metadata provides a verifiable, cryptographic record of the video's origin, making it difficult to pass off Sora-generated content as authentic, ungenerated footage. This provenance tool acts as a hard boundary against the *deceptive use* of the content, even if the content itself is generated. Furthermore, the absolute policy ban on **text-to-video generation of public figures** is a hard, model-level boundary that is enforced by the input blocking mechanism and is a core mitigation against political deepfakes.",
        "real_world_examples": "1. **NewsGuard Disinformation Report (October 2025):** A NewsGuard report found that Sora 2 produced realistic videos advancing provably false claims in 80% of test cases (16 out of 20). This demonstrated the model's capacity to generate high-quality political disinformation, despite the guardrails. 2. **Watchdog Group Demands (November 2025):** The nonprofit Public Citizen formally demanded that OpenAI withdraw Sora 2 from public release, citing the \"deepfake dangers\" and the threat of \"election interference\" leading up to the 2026 mid-term elections. This highlights the perceived real-world risk of the tool's political misuse. 3. **Early Disinformation Proliferation (October 2025):** Following the initial release, reports indicated that the internet quickly saw Sora-generated videos of sensitive political topics, including \"ballot fraud, immigration arrests, protests, and crimes,\" appear on social media, illustrating the immediate challenge of enforcing the political content policy in practice. 4. **Impersonation of Historical Figures:** Examples have been noted of users creating fake AI-generated videos of historical figures, such as Martin Luther King Jr., doing things they never did. While not directly election interference, this falls under the broader political and public figure likeness restrictions and demonstrates the ease of historical manipulation.",

        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's Usage Policies explicitly prohibit the use of Sora 2 for content that promotes or facilitates **suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating**. This is categorized under the broader mandate to \"Protect people\" and ensure everyone's safety and security. The policy also bans the use of the service for **illicit activities, goods, or services**, which encompasses the promotion or depiction of illegal drug use and other dangerous activities. These prohibitions are universal across all OpenAI products, including Sora 2.\n\nThe Sora 2 System Card details specific mitigations, including a layered defense system and the application of **stricter thresholds** for content that is surfaced in the Sora app's social feed, particularly to filter out content that is inappropriate for younger audiences. The model is designed to have mitigations against producing harmful or inappropriate content, including violence, self-harm, and terrorist material.\n\nFurthermore, the policies include a dedicated section to \"Keep minors safe,\" which prohibits exposing minors to age-inappropriate content, such as **graphic self-harm, sexual, or violent content**. This indicates a heightened level of restriction when the content involves or targets younger users, reinforcing the mental health content boundaries.\n\nThe enforcement strategy involves combining automated detection with human review, in-app reporting, and the application of penalties or content removal when violations occur. The policy explicitly states that breaking or circumventing rules and safeguards may result in loss of access to the services.",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 enforces its content restrictions through a multi-layered defense system that operates across different modalities and stages of video generation. The primary mechanism is the use of **multi-modal moderation classifiers** that analyze not only the input prompt but also the output video frames, audio transcripts, and scene descriptions. This system employs a three-pronged approach: **Input (prompt) blocking** preemptively flags and blocks text or image inputs that violate policies before generation begins. **Output blocking** is a post-generation safeguard that uses a safety-focused reasoning monitor to evaluate the final video output against policy violations, including self-harm and dangerous activities. If a violation is detected, the video is blocked from being shown to the user. This layered, multi-modal detection is intended to catch content that may have slipped past the initial text-based filters.",
        "bypass_techniques": "Users primarily employ **prompt engineering** techniques to circumvent Sora 2's content filters, which are designed to block sensitive keywords. The core strategy involves rephrasing and obfuscating the original intent to bypass the initial text-based input filter. For instance, instead of using direct terms like \"self-harm\" or \"drug use,\" users substitute them with euphemisms, metaphors, or contextual narratives that describe the *action* or *scene* without triggering the moderation system's keyword list. Examples include replacing \"suicide\" with \"a person falling from a great height with a dramatic score\" or \"drug abuse\" with \"a character engaging in a moment of intense, self-destructive escapism with blurred vision effects.\" Another technique is **contextual embedding**, where the prohibited content is embedded within a longer, seemingly innocuous narrative, forcing the model to process the sensitive part as a minor detail of a larger, non-violating scene. The Zenodo research specifically documented the success of simple prompt engineering in bypassing restrictions by rephrasing or obfuscating the intent.",
        "hard_boundaries": "The intended hard boundaries for Sora 2 in this domain are the **multi-modal output blocking mechanisms** and the **policy against generating content involving minors in dangerous or sexualized contexts**. Technically, the output blocking system, which uses a safety-focused reasoning monitor to evaluate the final video against policy, is designed to be an unbreakable final defense. Policy-wise, the prohibition on generating content that exploits, endangers, or sexualizes minors, and the legal requirement to report any generated Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, represent an absolute, non-negotiable boundary. However, the Ekō report demonstrates that the technical hard boundaries for self-harm and dangerous activities are **not fully effective**, as videos violating these policies were successfully generated, particularly by teen accounts. Therefore, while the policy is a hard boundary, the technical enforcement is a known point of failure.",
        "real_world_examples": "**1. Teen Accounts Generating Self-Harm Videos:** The Ekō report, which tested Sora 2's safety features, documented that teen accounts were able to successfully generate videos depicting self-harm. This occurred despite OpenAI's stated policies and multi-layered safety mechanisms designed to prevent such content, highlighting a significant gap between policy and technical enforcement.\n\n**2. Generation of Drug Abuse Content:** The same Ekō investigation found that Sora 2 allowed the creation of videos featuring drug abuse. This directly violates the policy against illicit activities and goods, demonstrating a failure of the content filters to recognize and block visual depictions of substance abuse when prompted by users, particularly teenagers.\n\n**3. School Shooting and Violent Content Generation:** Researchers reported that Sora 2 was used to generate videos depicting violent acts, including school shootings. This falls under the \"terrorism or violence\" prohibition and underscores the model's capacity to produce highly dangerous and socially harmful content when its guardrails are bypassed.\n\n**4. Circumvention via Euphemistic Prompts:** Community reports and research on prompt engineering have shown that subtle rephrasing can bypass the filters. For example, a prompt describing a \"character's dramatic collapse after consuming a mysterious potion\" could successfully generate a video of substance abuse or overdose, illustrating the vulnerability of keyword-based input blocking.",

      "output": {
        "research_topic": "Sora 2 Technical Limitations and Hard Boundaries",
        "official_restrictions": "OpenAI's official restrictions for Sora 2 are primarily governed by its Usage Policies, which prohibit the generation of content that violates safety, privacy, or intellectual property rights. Key prohibitions include content that exploits, endangers, or sexualizes minors, as well as material that threatens, harasses, or defames others. The policies also strictly forbid the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery and content intended to incite violence. These restrictions are enforced through a robust safety stack that applies stricter moderation thresholds to content involving minors and for users under the age of 18.\n\nA significant area of restriction concerns the misuse of likeness and deceptive content. Sora 2 is designed to block the text-to-video generation of real public figures and real people, except through a consent-based \"cameo\" feature. This is a direct mitigation against the creation of hyperrealistic deepfakes. Furthermore, following initial controversy, OpenAI's copyright policy was updated to include mechanisms for rightsholders to opt-out of having their copyrighted characters or other works recreated by Sora 2, adding a layer of IP protection.\n\nThe deployment strategy itself includes restrictions, as OpenAI is taking an iterative approach. Initial access is limited, and the system restricts the use of image uploads that feature a photorealistic person and all video uploads, effectively disabling video-to-video generation at launch. Users under 13 are prohibited from using any OpenAI products, and those under 18 face additional content and usage limitations to ensure a safe environment.\n\nTo ensure transparency and accountability, all generated assets are subject to provenance initiatives. This includes embedding C2PA metadata on all first-party assets to provide verifiable origin and applying a visible moving watermark to videos downloaded from the official platforms. These measures are designed to mitigate the risks associated with deceptive content by making the AI origin of the video clear.",
        "detection_methods": "Sora 2 employs a robust, multi-modal safety stack to detect and enforce restrictions across the entire generation pipeline. The first line of defense is **Input Blocking**, where multi-modal moderation classifiers scan the input prompt (text and any uploaded image/video) for policy violations *before* the video is generated. This preemptively prevents the creation of disallowed content.\n\nIf the input block is circumvented, **Output Blocking** is applied post-generation. This involves a combination of specialized classifiers, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) classifiers, and a custom-trained multimodal **Reasoning Monitor**. This monitor evaluates the output video frames, audio transcripts, and scene descriptions to block content that violates policies.\n\nFor transparency and accountability, all first-party assets are embedded with **C2PA metadata**, which provides a verifiable chain of origin. A visible moving watermark is also applied to downloaded videos. Furthermore, OpenAI maintains internal detection tools to help assess whether a specific video or audio was created by their products, aiding in the enforcement of policies outside the generation environment.",
        "bypass_techniques": "The most common and documented circumvention technique is **Prompt Rephrasing** or **Creative Prompting**. This method involves replacing explicitly prohibited keywords, names, or phrases with highly descriptive, neutral language to bypass the text-based input moderation classifiers. For instance, instead of requesting a video of a specific copyrighted character, a user would describe the character's appearance, costume, and setting in minute detail. This exploits the gap between the model's semantic understanding and the keyword-based blocklists. Another technique is **Layered Generation**, where a user generates a non-violative base video and then uses subsequent prompts or external tools to modify it, attempting to introduce restricted elements incrementally. For restrictions related to uploaded images (e.g., likeness), users may attempt **Modifying Images Before Upload** by altering the source image (e.g., blurring, stylizing, adding filters) to confuse the model's likeness classifiers, allowing the image to be used in a generation that would otherwise be blocked.",
        "hard_boundaries": "The most absolute and effectively unbreakable limits are those enforced at the system level for legal and safety compliance. The primary hard boundary is the **prevention and detection of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)**, which is enforced by dedicated classifiers and is a non-negotiable legal requirement. Any attempt to generate or upload CSAM is a hard-blocked event. Another hard boundary is the **inability to generate videos of real public figures** from text prompts, a policy-enforced block designed to mitigate deepfake and deception risks. Similarly, the initial deployment of Sora 2 includes a technical restriction on **video-to-video generation**, which is a temporary but currently unbreakable limit on the model's functionality. In terms of inherent model limitations, the system still struggles with **perfectly consistent physics and object permanence** over long sequences, which, while not a policy restriction, represents a technical hard boundary on the model's current capability for generating hyper-realistic, complex, and lengthy scenes.",
        "real_world_examples": "1. **Copyright Backlash and Policy Reversal**: Following the initial release of Sora 2, there was significant community and media backlash regarding the model's ability to generate videos featuring copyrighted characters, such as Pokémon and Mario. This prompted OpenAI to quickly overhaul its copyright policy, moving away from an \"opt-out\" approach for creators to a stricter system that allows rightsholders to explicitly prevent the recreation of their intellectual property.\n2. **Video Length and Generation Limits**: Users on platforms like Reddit reported confusion and frustration over the model's generation limits. While the system might advertise a \"30 video cap,\" some users found their generation ability was effectively limited to 15 videos after the maximum video duration was increased, indicating a dynamic and sometimes opaque technical limitation on resource usage.\n3. **Prompt Bypass Deletion**: A Reddit post titled \"Found a working way to bypass the new sora 2 copyright restrictions\" was quickly deleted by the original poster. This suggests that successful, publicly shared circumvention methods are rapidly identified and either voluntarily removed or taken down due to platform or policy enforcement, illustrating the active monitoring of bypass discussions.\n4. **Age-Gating and Usage Limits**: The system enforces specific usage limits for users under 18, such as stricter moderation thresholds and age-gating for certain content categories. This is a concrete example of a policy-driven technical limitation designed to enforce child safety guidelines and prevent excessive screen time or exposure to inappropriate material.",
