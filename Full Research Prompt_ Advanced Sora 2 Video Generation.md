# Full Research Prompt: Advanced Sora 2 Video Generation

This prompt is designed to be a comprehensive, multi-layered instruction for a research-focused Large Language Model (LLM) or a specialized AI agent, tasking it with generating the optimal, structured prompt for a Sora 2 video generation system. The goal is to maximize creative control, technical quality, and adherence to advanced prompting best practices.

The prompt utilizes a structured, template-driven approach to ensure all critical elements of a high-quality video are specified.

## 🎥 Sora 2 Advanced Prompt Generation Protocol

**Objective:** Generate a single, optimized Sora 2 text-to-video prompt that achieves **"never seen before quality"** and **"godmode"** level control over the final output, adhering to all IP-safe guidelines.

**Output Format:** The final output MUST be a single, cohesive text block, structured as follows:

```
[HOOK_SCENE_DESCRIPTION] | [BEAT_1_ACTION] | [BEAT_2_ACTION] | [PAYOFF_SCENE_DESCRIPTION] | [STYLIZATION_BLOCK] | [TECHNICAL_BLOCK]
```

---

### 1. [HOOK_SCENE_DESCRIPTION] (The First 2 Seconds)

**Instruction:** Define a visually arresting, high-impact opening scene designed to maximize audience retention within the first two seconds.

*   **Focus:** Extreme close-up, dynamic motion, or immediate visual paradox.
*   **Example:** *A single, hyper-detailed drop of neon-blue water hanging suspended in zero gravity, reflecting a distant, impossible cityscape.*

### 2. [BEAT_1_ACTION] (The Setup)

**Instruction:** Define the primary action or character introduction that sets up the narrative.

*   **Focus:** Clear subject, defined movement, and immediate environmental interaction.
*   **Example:** *The drop of water shatters against the chrome visor of a stylized, 1980s-era astronaut who is slowly floating through a field of glowing, geometric debris.*

### 3. [BEAT_2_ACTION] (The Conflict/Development)

**Instruction:** Define the narrative development or conflict that drives the scene toward the payoff.

*   **Focus:** Change in camera angle, introduction of a secondary element, or escalation of the primary action.
*   **Example:** *A sudden, violent shift in gravity throws the astronaut into a rapid, uncontrolled spin. A massive, monolithic structure appears in the background, pulsating with deep red light.*

### 4. [PAYOFF_SCENE_DESCRIPTION] (The Climax/Resolution)

**Instruction:** Define the final, climactic scene that resolves the short narrative arc.

*   **Focus:** Final visual punch, thematic resolution, or unexpected twist.
*   **Example:** *The astronaut stabilizes, pulls out a comically oversized, retro-futuristic remote control, and presses a single red button. The monolithic structure instantly collapses into a shower of digital confetti.*

### 5. [STYLIZATION_BLOCK] (Aesthetics and Vibe Replication)

**Instruction:** Define the comprehensive stylistic and aesthetic parameters.

*   **Focus:** Combine at least three distinct, high-fidelity aesthetic descriptors.
*   **Required Elements:**
    *   **Core Aesthetic:** *e.g., :cybercore, :vaporwave, :horrorcore*
    *   **Artistic Style:** *e.g., Unreal Engine 5, Octane Render, Studio Ghibli Parody*
    *   **Lighting/Color:** *e.g., Volumetric lighting, deep shadows, neon magenta and cyan palette*
    *   **IP-Safe Parody:** *e.g., No real people, no photoreal faces, no brands, highly stylized cartoon physics.*

### 6. [TECHNICAL_BLOCK] (Camera and Production Control)

**Instruction:** Define the precise technical specifications for maximum control over the video output.

*   **Focus:** Camera movement, lens type, aspect ratio, and duration.
*   **Required Elements:**
    *   **Camera:** *e.g., 35mm lens, anamorphic, deep depth of field, low angle*
    *   **Movement:** *e.g., Slow, smooth 360-degree dolly shot, sudden whip pan, cinematic crane shot*
    *   **Resolution/Aspect Ratio:** *e.g., 4K, 16:9 cinematic aspect ratio*
    *   **Duration:** *e.g., 5.0 seconds*

---

### 7. Beatmap and Audio Directives (Separate Output)

**Instruction:** Provide a separate, time-coded beatmap and audio notes to accompany the main prompt.

*   **Beatmap:** Time-code the transitions between the four main scenes (Hook, Beat 1, Beat 2, Payoff).
    *   *Example:* `Beatmap: H0.00 | B1.50 | B2.80 | P4.50`
*   **Audio Notes:** Define the sound design.
    *   *Example:* `Audio notes: synthwave track, digital static burst, deep bass drop, confetti sound effect`

### 8. Final Output Generation

**Task:** Generate the final, single-block Sora 2 prompt and the separate Beatmap/Audio directives based on the instructions above.

**Final Prompt Example (Conceptual):**

```
