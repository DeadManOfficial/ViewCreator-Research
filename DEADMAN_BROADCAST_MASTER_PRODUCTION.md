## VISUAL LOOP LIBRARY - SORA 2 PROMPTS

### 🔴 LOOP A: Signal Hijack (Universal Opening)
**Duration**: 10 seconds | **Use Case**: Segment opens, transitions, emphasis moments

**Prompt:**
Macro close-up of a customized radio broadcast console in a pitch-black room. A red "ON AIR" tally light flickers erratically at 2 Hz, casting harsh crimson illumination across scratched metallic dials and worn Bakelite knobs. Behind the console, a wall of vintage CRT monitors displays cascading green phosphor text and rapid binary code flashes. Camera: locked macro shot, 100mm equivalent lens, f/2.8 for shallow depth isolating the tally light with razor focus while monitors blur into ambient glow. Lighting: single harsh red key from tally light creating deep black shadows; cool cyan-blue fill spilling from CRT screens; high contrast ratio 20:1. Texture: dust particles visible in the red light beam, fingerprint smudges on chrome surfaces. Action beats: Light flickers on (beat 1) — holds steady (2 seconds) — double flicker (beat 2) — dims slightly (beat 3) — returns to full intensity. Sound design cues: heavy 60Hz electrical hum, intermittent analog static burst every 3 seconds, distant cooling fan whir, faint electromagnetic interference crackle.

**Technical Notes**: Film grain overlay at 20% opacity, slight vignette, color grade toward cold desaturated palette except for red accent.

---

### 📂 LOOP B: Corporate Archive Room
**Duration**: 10 seconds | **Use Case**: Exposés, document reveals, corporate crime segments

**Prompt:**
Wide shot of an abandoned corporate archive room, fluorescent lights flickering overhead at irregular intervals. Metal filing cabinets line concrete walls, drawers pulled open with manila folders spilling onto a dust-covered floor. In the foreground, a gloved hand slowly pulls a classified document stamped "CONFIDENTIAL - PROJECT PICARD" from a weathered folder. Camera: slow dolly forward from wide to medium shot, 35mm lens equivalent, steady Steadicam movement tracking at 0.5 feet per second. Lighting: cold overhead fluorescent tubes casting green-tinted institutional light; one tube flickers creating strobing effect; harsh shadows under cabinet overhangs. Color palette: institutional green, manila tan, oxidized metal gray, deep shadow black. Action sequence: Hand enters frame right (beat 1) — fingers grasp document edge (beat 2) — document slides out revealing red stamp (beat 3) — hand pauses, document fully visible (beat 4). Atmosphere: water stain on ceiling, cobwebs in corners, scattered paper debris, faint mold texture on walls. Sound: fluorescent buzz at 120Hz, paper rustle, distant water drip echo, metal cabinet creak.

**Technical Notes**: Slight lens distortion for institutional unease, desaturated color grade except red stamp, subtle film grain.

---

### 🎙️ LOOP C: Underground Studio
**Duration**: 10 seconds | **Use Case**: Podcast segments, media criticism, voice-of-god moments

**Prompt:**
Low-angle view inside a claustrophobic makeshift broadcast studio built in a concrete basement. A vintage broadcast microphone hangs from a shock mount, illuminated by a single bare Edison bulb swaying slightly, casting moving shadows across foam acoustic panels zip-tied to exposed brick walls. In the background, tangled XLR cables snake across the floor toward a laptop displaying green waveform analysis. Camera: static low angle looking up at microphone, 24mm wide lens for slight perspective distortion emphasizing ceiling height, locked tripod position. Lighting: single warm 2700K Edison bulb as practical key light creating hard shadows; laptop screen provides cool blue fill on cables; one edge of frame catches red EXIT sign glow from off-screen. Color temperature: warm amber key contrasts cold digital blue. Atmosphere: visible dust motes floating in bulb light, condensation forming on exposed water pipes overhead, graffiti partially visible on brick. Action: Bulb sways gently left to right (3-second period) — shadows shift across acoustic foam — cables remain static. Sound texture: light bulb filament hum, distant basement machinery rumble, faint electrical buzz from laptop, air movement from unseen ventilation.

**Technical Notes**: High contrast lighting 15:1 ratio, mild film grain, slight handheld micro-vibration for authenticity.

### 🌐 LOOP D: Data Stream Visualization
**Duration**: 10 seconds | **Use Case**: Leak segments, hacker aesthetic, information warfare

**Prompt:**
Extreme close-up of a mechanical keyboard with RGB backlighting cycling through blue and purple hues. Fingers type rapidly in short bursts while holographic data streams flow upward from the keys, displaying fragmented text: "CLASSIFIED", "EMBARGO", "NDA BREACH". Behind the keyboard, three stacked monitors show scrolling terminal windows with white text on black background, IP addresses, and file transfer progress bars. Camera: macro close-up on fingers and keys, 85mm lens at f/1.4 creating bokeh on background monitors, slight handheld micro-shake for documentary realism. Lighting: RGB keyboard underglow as primary source (blue-purple gradient); cool white monitor spill as fill; one practical desk lamp with green banker shade off-frame right creating rim light on hands. Color scheme: electric blue, deep purple, matrix green, bone white text. Action choreography: Fingers strike keys in deliberate rhythm (beat 1: three keys) — pause half-second — (beat 2: rapid five-key sequence) — hands lift slightly — (beat 3: single emphatic key strike). Data stream animations: holographic text rises at 30px/second, slight digital glitch effect every 2 seconds. Sound design: mechanical keyboard clicks (Cherry MX Blue profile), hard drive seek noise, digital data transfer chirps, faint cooling fan.

**Technical Notes**: Slight chromatic aberration on holographic elements, 10% film grain, sharp focus rack from keys to monitors at midpoint.

---

### 🕵️ LOOP E: Surveillance Feed
**Duration**: 10 seconds | **Use Case**: Corporate espionage, leak culture, truth-seeking narrative

**Prompt:**
Security camera perspective from ceiling corner of a corporate office hallway at night. Emergency exit signs cast red glow on white walls. A silhouetted figure in a dark hoodie walks toward camera carrying a messenger bag, stops at a door marked "SERVER ROOM - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY", glances up at camera, then swipes an RFID badge. The door opens, spilling bright blue server light into the hallway. Camera: fixed CCTV angle from 8 feet high, 16mm fisheye lens creating barrel distortion, simulated 720p digital compression artifacts and timestamp overlay "23:47:18" in top-right corner. Lighting: red EXIT sign practical lights; cool fluorescent hallway overhead creating flat institutional ambiance; harsh blue-white LED server room spill at door opening. Monochrome palette: desaturated near-grayscale with slight green tint typical of night vision mode, red and blue accents preserved. Action timeline: Figure enters frame from bottom (beat 1, 2 seconds) — walks forward three steps (beat 2) — stops and looks up at camera (beat 3, holds 1 second) — swipes badge (beat 4) — door opens revealing blue light (beat 5). Surveillance artifacts: slight digital noise, one frame drop at 4-second mark, faint VCR tracking line across middle of frame. Sound: hollow hallway acoustics, badge beep, electronic lock release, server fan whir crescendo as door opens.

**Technical Notes**: Apply digital compression, add timestamp and "REC" indicator, slight jitter every 3 seconds to simulate DVR recording.

---

### 🎮 LOOP F: Retro Gaming Graveyard
**Duration**: 10 seconds | **Use Case**: Gaming history segments, nostalgia, industry death

**Prompt:**
Close-up dolly shot through a dark storage room filled with stacks of unsold video game cases and cartridges from failed launches. Dust-covered PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube boxes are piled haphazardly. In the foreground, a hand in a leather glove picks up a pristine copy of "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided" collector's edition, its shrink wrap still intact, holding it up to dim overhead light. Camera: slow dolly right-to-left at shelf height, 50mm lens at f/2.0 for selective focus separating subject from cluttered background. Lighting: single overhead 40-watt incandescent bulb creating warm but weak key light; deep shadows in background; dust particles visible in light shaft. Color grading: desaturated with warm sepia undertone, except game box art colors remain slightly punched. Atmosphere: thick dust layer on every surface, cobwebs connecting boxes, water damage stains on cardboard, faint mildew texture. Action beats: Hand enters frame (beat 1) — fingers brush dust from box surface creating small cloud (beat 2) — lifts box into light shaft (beat 3) — rotates box slowly revealing cover art (beat 4) — holds position. Background detail: visible game titles on spines including "Lawbreakers", "Anthem", "Marvel's Avengers" — all commercial failures. Sound: creaking wood shelves, dust settling, cardboard friction, distant warehouse ambience.

**Technical Notes**: Heavy vignette, film grain at 25%, slight lens breathing during dolly move.

1. **Voice Compression**: Heavy ratio (8:1), fast attack, medium release
2. **Distortion**: Tube saturation plugin at 20-30% mix
3. **EQ**: Cut below 80Hz, boost 2-4kHz (presence), slight cut at 8kHz (harshness)
4. **Reverb**: Short plate (0.8s decay) at 15% mix for "concrete room" feel
5. **Final Limiter**: -1dB ceiling, aggressive makeup gain

### Visual Export Settings
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (can upscale to 4K if needed)

- **Color Grade**: Log profile with heavy contrast curve
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (standard) or 9:16 (TikTok/Shorts vertical)

### Sora 2 Rendering Guidelines
- Each prompt is optimized for 10-second generation
- Loop segments to reach full duration
- Use crossfade transitions (0.5s) between different visual loops
- Apply film grain overlay in post (20-25% opacity)
- Add subtle vignette (15% strength)

### Content Strategy
- Upload to YouTube as podcast episodes (full segments)
- Cut to 60-second versions for TikTok/Instagram Reels
