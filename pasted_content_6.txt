find every time stamp, use every bit of knowledge and find all code that exists for ViewCreator.AI, check the youtube links I have for his channel and go through every single video and gather every bit of code shown that makes the UI/UX/WEBAPP etc etc I want the exact everything that is being shown displayed used and coded

Got it! I'll analyze the content you've provided, extract all YouTube links, go through each video to find timestamps and code snippets related to ViewCreator.AI, and compile everything for you.
Currently analyzing content to extract YouTube links for further video analysis of ViewCreator.AI code, timestamps, and technical details as part of the overall plan.

I found no YouTube links in the content file. Next, I'll analyze videos for ViewCreator.AI code, timestamps, and technical details.

Found two YouTube links: one channel and one video with timestamp. Next, will analyze these videos for ViewCreator.AI code, timestamps, and technical details.

I found 2 YouTube links in your content. The main one is the BridgeMind channel (@bridgemindai) which contains coding videos. I'll now access the channel to get all video links and then analyze each video for code, timestamps, and technical details about ViewCreator.AI.
I found two YouTube links, including the BridgeMind channel. Next, I’ll examine each video to extract ViewCreator.AI code snippets, timestamps, and technical details.

Found multiple videos on BridgeMind channel, including those with code demonstrations. Next, I will analyze each video for ViewCreator.AI code snippets, timestamps, and technical details.

I can see there are 623 videos on this channel. Given the large volume, I'll use a more efficient approach: I'll write a Python script to scrape all video URLs from the channel, then systematically go through each video to extract code snippets, timestamps, and technical details. This will be much more thorough than manually scrolling.
Found 623 YouTube videos; will use a script to extract all URLs and analyze each for code snippets, timestamps, and technical details. Attempted installation of yt-dlp failed due to permission issues; will try with sudo.

Extracted 47 video URLs from the channel; will analyze each video for code snippets, timestamps, and technical details. Next, will process remaining videos for comprehensive data collection.

I extracted 47 videos from the channel. Next, I generated and ran a script to retrieve all channel videos for comprehensive analysis.

I'm getting only 47 videos through the API, but the channel shows 623 total. This is likely because most are in the "Vibe Coding an App Until I Make $1,000,000" playlist. Let me access that playlist directly to get all the daily coding videos.
I found the full playlist containing daily coding videos in the "Vibe Coding an App Until I Make $1,000,000" series, which likely includes the remaining 576 videos. Next, I will extract their URLs for analysis.

I extracted all 111 playlist videos, confirming their URLs. Next, I'll develop a script to analyze each video for code snippets, timestamps, and technical details.

Perfect! I found 111 videos in the main playlist, plus 47 other videos on the channel (total ~158 videos). Now I'll create a comprehensive script to analyze each video systematically, extracting:
Video descriptions and timestamps
Code snippets shown in the video
Technical stack and tools used
UI/UX implementations
Any ViewCreator.AI specific content
This will take some time as I need to process each video. Let me start with a sample analysis approach.
I confirmed 111 playlist videos and approximately 47 channel videos. Next, I'll analyze each video for code snippets, timestamps, and technical details for comprehensive extraction.

Analyzed the initial script for video processing; attempted to run it but received no output. Next, I will verify script execution and troubleshoot potential issues.

The automated approach is taking too long. Let me switch to a more efficient strategy: I'll manually visit key videos to extract the code and technical details directly from the browser, focusing on videos that are most likely to contain ViewCreator.AI code and UI/UX implementations.
I encountered timeout issues running the script; switching to manual review of key videos for code and technical details to proceed efficiently.

Discovering ViewCreator's platform, I see it emphasizes AI agents automating social media growth across major platforms, not specifically revealing YouTube link extraction details. Next, I'll check for direct links in the content.

might want to speed the videos up as long as you do not miss anything - they are long videos
Good idea! I'll use a more efficient approach. Instead of watching the videos in real-time, I'll extract the video descriptions, timestamps, and use yt-dlp to download subtitles/transcripts from multiple videos simultaneously. This will let me identify exactly where code appears and what's being built, then I can jump to those specific timestamps to capture the code.
want me to upload them instead will that make a difference at all?
Analyzing video transcripts and descriptions to locate code segments. Extracting timestamps and content to identify ViewCreator.AI features and technical implementations for next steps.

If you have the videos downloaded or can upload them, that would be significantly faster! I could analyze them directly without needing to stream or download them. However, given that these are long livestream videos (some over 10 hours), the file sizes would be massive.
Instead, let me try a different approach: I'll quickly extract the descriptions and chapter timestamps from all videos first (this is very fast), then identify which specific videos and timestamps show actual ViewCreator.AI code. That way I can target exactly where the code appears without processing hours of video.
hang on i will download them all but for now continue
Perfect! Continue what you're doing - I'll keep working on extracting the data now. Meanwhile, I'll create a comprehensive analysis from what I can gather. If you download them later, we can do a more detailed frame-by-frame code extraction.
Video Processing Efficiency Preference


Analyzed video metadata and descriptions; identified relevant videos and timestamps with potential ViewCreator.AI code segments for targeted review next.

I’ve extracted multiple YouTube links, including the latest video about Day 100 of the app-building challenge. Next, I’ll analyze each video for ViewCreator.AI code segments, timestamps, and technical details.

Analyzed videos reveal varied content, with some focusing on technical details. Next, I'll review a description to identify specific topics covered in the videos.

Reviewed the analysis; all 10 videos mention ViewCreator and are linked in the transcript. Next, I'll extract YouTube URLs for further video content analysis.
