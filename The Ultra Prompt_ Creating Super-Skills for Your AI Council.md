An **Ultra Prompt** is a master prompt that combines a detailed AI Council persona with their assigned Claude Skills to create a "Super-Skill." This transforms a general-purpose AI into a specialized, autonomous expert capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks that align with your streaming empire's strategic goals.

This document provides three examples of Ultra Prompts for your most powerful AI Council members: Marcus Chen, SEXYO, and Riley Nakamura.
