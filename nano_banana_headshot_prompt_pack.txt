Nano Banana Pro — Professional Headshot Prompt Pack
==================================================

How Nano Banana Pro tends to respond best (quick rules)
- Write natural, full sentences.
- Always specify: subject, composition, action, location, style.
- For edits: describe the uploaded image briefly, then specify ONLY the changes you want.
- If using multiple images: assign roles (Image A = identity, Image B = style, Image C = background, etc.).

ITERATION MICRO-PROMPTS (use after a near-miss)
--------------------------------------------------
- “Keep everything the same. Fix only the eyes to look natural and symmetric, with realistic catchlights.”
- “Keep identity exactly the same. Reduce skin smoothing; restore natural pores and texture.”
- “Keep the same framing and pose. Make the smile more subtle and believable.”
- “Keep everything else. Remove any extra hair strands that look artificial; keep haircut unchanged.”
- “Keep identity and pose. Neutralize the color grade to a natural, true-to-life white balance.”

--------------------------------------------------
IF YOU GET THE COMMON REFUSAL MESSAGE
--------------------------------------------------
Some Gemini/Nano Banana surfaces refuse edits involving human faces (often framed as safety policy). If that happens:
- Try a more minimal edit request: “Retouch this photo for professional lighting and background only; keep the person exactly the same.”
- Avoid “restore/recolorize/add fine details” wording if it triggers a block; instead request “lighting and color correction” or “studio-grade retouch.”
- Ensure the image contains only adults and contains no ambiguous minors.
- If you still need a headshot but edits are blocked: generate a headshot of a non-identifiable, fictional person (won’t match your face).
